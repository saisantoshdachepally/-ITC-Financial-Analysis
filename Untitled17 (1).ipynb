The Company\\'s credo of ‘Nation First, Sab Saath Badhein’ is manifest in ITC\\'s century-old engagement with farmers, state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities and iconic hospitality properties, cutting-edge R&D, world-class Indian brands and multi-dimensional initiatives that address challenges of climate change and livelihood generation. ITC\\'s presence across agriculture, manufacturing and services enables it to make a larger contribution to the national economy.\\nITC is today rapidly progressing on its journey to shape a future-ready enterprise, premised on its vision to create larger societal value through a paradigm of Responsible Competitiveness. This assumes even more signiﬁcance as the world navigates an era of unprecedented challenges and uncertainties. Escalating climate change and its impact on food security, geo-political tensions, supply chain disruptions, a global debt crisis amongst others, are indeed daunting issues. Equally unmatched is the speed of change, driven by several factors including the technological and digital revolution. Amidst the global turbulence, India has emerged as a beacon of hope led by the Government\\'s vision for Viksit Bharat. This has been powered by the remarkable progress in physical and digital infrastructure, structural reforms in the ﬁnancial sector, as well as the thrust on establishing the country as a manufacturing and services hub in a reglobalising world economy. The nation is also a leader in climate action with path-breaking interventions. Indeed, India offers exciting opportunities for growth as it marches into the future with a young and dynamic demographic proﬁle, rapid urbanisation, rising incomes, growing consumption, technological prowess and accelerated digital adoption. Pivoting sharply to the new context, the ITC Next strategy is being rigorously pursued to shape the next horizon of growth and proﬁtability. The extensive ii strategy reset unleashes new drivers of structural competitiveness by strengthening the multiple drivers of growth, Innovation and R&D, building agile, resilient and efﬁcient Supply Chains, mainstreaming Digital Adoption, Sustainability, and ensuring Cost Optimisation. The ITC Next strategy focuses on exploring opportunities to craft disruptive business models anchored at the intersection of the mega trends of Digital and Sustainability, while leveraging the Company\\'s institutional strengths. At the core is also the sharp thrust of the ITC Next strategy on agility, consumer centricity and inspired talent. Pillars of ITC NEXT Reinforcing ITC\\'s strategy of multiple drivers of growth, ITC Next focuses on building a future-ready portfolio leveraging its enterprise strengths and the emerging mega trends. A three-horizon growth strategy has been envisioned by enhancing and enlarging the leadership of its core businesses, given their immense potential for growth; scaling up emerging categories by addressing adjacencies and incubating ideas for the next horizon to build solutions for the future.\\nInnovation and R&D will be important vectors to power growth in the future. Over the years, ITC\\'s Life Sciences and Technology Centre in Bengaluru, ranked as the top private sector innovator in India, has emerged as a robust innovation engine. Reinforced with world-class infrastructure and resourced with a team of over 400 talented scientists, LSTC drives purposeful and agile innovation that fulﬁls the needs of the consumers through superior offerings, providing a competitive edge to ITC\\'s businesses. ITC Next focuses on building structural competitiveness through agile, resilient and efﬁcient Supply Chains. ITC\\'s world-class brands derive competitive strength not only from their high quality and differentiated offerings but also from ITC\\'s extensive agri value chains that beneﬁt millions of farmers, and state-of-the-art, digitally enriched manufacturing and distribution infrastructure. ITC Next: Shaping a Future-Ready Enterprise that Puts Nation First iii Signiﬁcant investments in state-of-the-art Integrated Consumer Goods Manufacturing and Logistics facilities provide structural advantages to ITC\\'s FMCG businesses by ensuring product freshness, enhancing agility and responsiveness, and reducing cost of servicing proximal markets. ITC\\'s omni-channel distribution infrastructure today reaches over 25 crore households in India.\\nITC\\'s vision to be a Future Tech Enterprise is powered by \\'Mission DigiArc\\', a next-generation smart digital architecture based on a \\'digital ﬁrst\\' culture, to create a new source of competitive advantage. ITC has accelerated digital adoption across every node of its businesses and value chains. A multitude of projects are transforming all facets of ITC\\'s operations – from insighting to product development, smart sourcing to smart supply chain to smart trade as also superior brand engagement and marketing through real-time content, connect and commerce. This intelligent, digital architecture is embedded with cutting-edge technologies in AI/ML together with Centres of Excellence in Industry 4.0, Advanced Analytics and Data Sciences as well as the 6th Sense Marketing Command Centre.\\nIt is ITC\\'s conviction that what is good for the planet is good for business. ITC\\'s sustainability interventions are not only designed for risk mitigation and building resilience, but also are a source of competitive advantage. ITC has been an exemplar in sustainability, embracing pro-active climate action together with support to livelihood generation at scale. ITC is the only enterprise globally to be water, carbon and solid waste recycling positive for over a decade. ITC\\'s businesses support 60 lakh sustainable livelihoods. As part of ITC Next, ITC has embraced a bold new Sustainability 2.0 agenda, setting the bar even higher. Sustainability 2.0, which reimagines sustainability under the pressing challenges of climate change and social inequity, calls for inclusive strategies that can support sustainable livelihoods, pursue newer ways to ﬁght climate change, enable the transition to a net zero economy, work towards ensuring water security for all and create an effective circular economy for post-consumer packaging waste. It envisions protecting and restoring biodiversity and ecosystem services through adoption of nature-based solutions. ITC\\'s products are progressively embedding purpose, recognising the power of the brands to drive social action.

ITC Limited has been one of the frontrunners in India to have put in place a formalised system of Corporate Governance. Its governance framework enjoins the highest standards of ethical and responsible conduct of business to create value for all stakeholders. THE COMPANY’S GOVERNANCE PHILOSOPHY ITC defines Corporate Governance as a systemic process by which companies are directed and controlled to enhance their wealth-generating capacity. Since large corporations employ a vast quantum of societal resources, ITC believes that the governance process should ensure that these resources are utilised in a manner that meets stakeholders’ aspirations and societal expectations. This belief is reflected in the Company’s deep commitment to contribute to the “triple bottom line”, namely conservation and development of the nation’s economic, social and environmental capital. ITC’s Corporate Governance structure, systems and processes are based on two core principles: (i) \\x07 Management must have the executive freedom to drive the enterprise forward without undue restraints, and (ii)\\t\\x07 This freedom of management should be exercised within a framework of effective accountability.\\nITC believes that any meaningful policy on Corporate Governance must empower the executive management of the Company. At the same time, Governance should create a mechanism of checks and balances to ensure that the decision-making powers vested in the executive management are used with care and responsibility to meet stakeholders’ aspirations and societal expectations.\\nFrom this definition and core principles of Corporate Governance emerge the cornerstones of ITC’s governance philosophy, namely trusteeship, transparency, ethical corporate citizenship, empowerment & accountability and control. ITC believes that the practice of each of these creates the right corporate culture that fulfils the true purpose of Corporate Governance. 14 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 ITC Limited Report on Corporate Governance THE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE The practice of Corporate Governance in ITC takes place at three interlinked levels: Strategic supervision by the Board of Directors Strategic management by the Corporate Management Committee Executive management by the Divisional Chief Executive assisted by the Divisional Management Committee The three-tier governance structure ensures that: (a)\\t\\x07 Strategic supervision (on behalf of the Shareholders), being free from involvement in the task of strategic management of the Company, can be conducted with objectivity, thereby sharpening accountability of management; (b)\\t\\x07 Strategic management of the Company, uncluttered by the day-to-day tasks of executive management, remains focused and energised; and (c)\\t\\x07 Executive management of the divisional business free from collective strategic responsibilities for ITC as a whole, remains focused on enhancing the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of the business to achieve best-in-class performance.\\nThe core roles of the key entities flow from this structure. These roles, in turn, determine the core responsibilities of each entity. In order to discharge such responsibilities, each entity is empowered formally with requisite powers.\\nREPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 15 ITC Limited Trusteeship recognises that large corporations which represent a coalition of interests, namely those of the shareholders, other providers of capital, business associates and employees, have both an economic and a social purpose, thereby casting the responsibility on the Board of Directors to protect and enhance shareholder value, as well as fulfil obligations to other stakeholders. Inherent in the concept of trusteeship is the responsibility to ensure equity, namely, that the rights of all shareholders, large or small, are protected.\\nTrusteeship Transparency Transparency means explaining the Company’s policies and actions to those to whom it has responsibilities. Externally, this means maximum appropriate disclosures without jeopardising the Company’s strategic interests and internally, this means openness in the Company’s relationship with its employees and in the conduct of its business. ITC believes transparency enhances accountability.\\nEthical Corporate Citizenship means setting exemplary standards of ethical behaviour, both internally within the organisation, as well as in external relationships. ITC believes that unethical behaviour corrupts organisational culture and undermines stakeholder value. Governance processes in ITC continuously reinforce and help realise the Company’s belief in ethical corporate citizenship.\\nEthical Corporate Citizenship Control ensures that freedom of management is exercised within a framework of checks and balances, and is designed to prevent misuse of power, facilitate timely management of change and ensure effective management of risks. ITC believes that control is a necessary concomitant of its second core principle of governance that freedom of management should be exercised within a framework of effective accountability. Control Empowerment is a process of unleashing creativity and innovation throughout the organisation by truly vesting decision-making powers at the most appropriate levels and as close to the scene of action as feasible, thereby helping actualise the potential of its employees. Empowerment is an essential concomitant of ITC’s first core principle of governance that management must have the freedom to drive the enterprise forward. ITC believes that empowerment combined with accountability provides an impetus to performance and improves effectiveness, thereby enhancing shareholder value. Empowerment & Accountability The structure, processes and practices of governance are designed to support effective management of multiple businesses while retaining focus on each one of them.\\nThe Governance Document that sets out the structure, policies and practices of governance is available on the Company’s corporate website at https://www.itcportal.com/governance-document .

Advanced Economies grew by 1.6% with the US economy belying expectations of recession with a resilient performance in 2023, registering a growth of 2.5% (Vs. 1.9% in 2022). Emerging Markets & Developing Economies grew at a relatively faster pace of 4.3% (Vs. 4.1% in 2022), though remaining well below the long period average. The recent conflict in the Middle East, extreme weather events and the overlapping shocks of the past four years – COVID pandemic, Russia-Ukraine conflict, unprecedented inflation and subsequent sharp increase in interest rates – have rendered the global macroeconomic environment highly uncertain and volatile. Going forward, aggregate global economic growth as per IMF estimates is expected to remain subdued at 3.2% in 2024, well below the historical (2000-19) annual average of 3.8%. In 2024, Advanced Economies are projected to grow at 1.7% while Emerging Markets and Developing Economies are estimated to grow at 4.2%. With expectations of inflation easing towards target levels, the timing of central banks pivoting towards policy easing in major economies remains a key monitorable in the near term.\\nIndia remained a relatively bright spot amidst the global slowdown, recording robust Real GDP growth of 7.6% in FY 2023-24. Growth was primarily driven by Fixed Investments led by Government’s thrust on infrastructure creation and household investments in real estate. Private Consumption, on the other hand, grew 3.0% - its slowest pace in two decades. The weakness in consumption was reflected, inter alia, in the muted volume growth of the FMCG sector (FY 2023-24 Volume growth appx. 3% Vs. 7% p.a. average in the pre-pandemic period). While Industry and Services sectors grew by 9.0% and 7.5% respectively, growth in the Agri sector slowed to 0.7%, with adverse weather events impacting harvests.\\nGoing forward, the Indian economy is expected to sustain its high growth trajectory in FY 2024-25 driven by strong momentum in Fixed Investments and a pick-up in Private Consumption on the back of moderation in inflation, improvement in agri terms of trade, a good Rabi harvest and normal monsoons. Green shoots of recovery in rural markets, improving employment conditions and sustained momentum in manufacturing and services sectors augur well for consumption demand in the near term. India continues to be acknowledged as one of the fastest growing major economies in the world with significant headroom for growth over the medium and long-term benefiting from a slew of purposeful Management Discussion and Analysis For the Financial Year Ended 31st March, 2024 & Going forward, the Indian economy is expected to sustain its high growth trajectory in FY 2024-25 driven by strong momentum in Fixed Investments and a pick-up in Private Consumption on the back of moderation in inflation, improvement in agri terms of trade, a good Rabi harvest and normal monsoons.\\nREPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 43 ITC Limited interventions over several years. A favourable demographic profile, increasing affluence, rapid urbanisation and accelerated digital adoption represent some of the key structural drivers of growth of the Indian Economy. Multi-dimensional interventions undertaken by the Government of India towards expansion of physical and digital public infrastructure, enhancing the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector, indirect/direct taxation and financial sector reforms along with measures to promote ease of doing business are expected to power the economy going forward. While stepped-up capital expenditure outlay and focus on infrastructure are expected to drive growth in domestic manufacturing, focus on agri-related schemes are expected to boost farmers’ welfare and rural consumption demand, spurring a virtuous investment-employment-consumption cycle.\\nAs the Indian economy contends with uncertainties in the external environment, policy interventions focused on supporting sustainable livelihoods and fostering inclusive growth augur well for the economy. Structural support would need to be provided to sectors with large economic multiplier impact. In this regard, the development of robust domestic agri and wood-based value chains hold special importance in the Indian context given their enormous potential to contribute to national objectives.\\nThe agricultural sector is pivotal to the Indian economy, employing about half of the country’s workforce. India is amongst the leading producers in the world of several agri-commodities, including milk, rice, wheat, sugarcane, cotton, pulses, spices, fruits & vegetables. While India’s agri exports have grown strongly in recent years to a peak of US$ 53 billion in FY 2022-23, it witnessed a decline to US$ 49 billion in FY 2023-24 due to restrictions imposed during the year on agri-commodity trading led by concerns over food security and inflation on the back of geopolitical tensions and climate emergencies. India’s share of global agri-trade remains low at only about 3%. Enhancing agricultural productivity and value addition to international standards, while simultaneously improving market linkages, remain critical to enhance competitiveness of the agri sector and drive significant increase in farmers’ income.\\nThe farm sector faces enormous threats arising out of climate change as evident from the growing number of extreme weather events such as droughts and floods. Given the vulnerabilities, it is critical to strengthen climate resilience and adaptability of the agri-food sector. An exponential increase in crop production and productivity, backed by climate smart agriculture, will be critical in meeting the growing needs of an increasing population as also in mitigating potential risks. Evolving consumer preferences are also driving a shift towards nutritious and sustainably sourced food products. These developments accentuate the need to enhance the competitiveness of agri value chains to cater to the dynamic market requirements of the future. India, with its tremendous strengths in this sector, has a unique opportunity to play a leading role in this global transition and in forging an eco-system of sustainable, regenerative and climate smart agriculture.\\nIn this regard, the Government’s focus on promoting Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) holds immense potential to catalyse agricultural transformation by leveraging economies of scale, enabling sustainable Report of the Board of Directors The agricultural sector is pivotal to the Indian Economy. Enhancing agricultural productivity and value addition to international standards, while simultaneously improving market linkages, remain critical to strengthening competitiveness of the agri sector and drive significant increase in farmers’ income.\\n44 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 ITC Limited agriculture, supporting market-led production and creating larger market access. Government interventions encouraging private and public investment in post-harvest activities including aggregation, modern storage, efficient supply chain, primary and secondary processing, marketing and branding are steps in the right direction and will go a long way in unlocking the full potential of the agri\\xa0sector.\\nIn this context, your Company has adopted targeted collaborative models to multiply the scale and impact of its agri and rural interventions. This\\xa0collaborative approach, as opposed to a traditional transactional approach, can contribute meaningfully towards building next generation agriculture that is climate resilient and capable of supporting gainful livelihoods. Digitalisation of agriculture also offers the potential to increase productivity and foster structural changes across the value chain thereby enabling efficient use of resources. In line with its commitment to harness the power of cutting-edge digital technologies and NextGen agri practices towards unlocking the potential of India’s farmers, your Company had launched ITCMAARS (Metamarket for Advanced Agriculture and Rural Services). The\\xa0initiative continues to be scaled up rapidly and currently covers over 1.5 million farmers and over 1,650 FPOs, across 10 states and over 18,000 villages. This ‘phygital’ ecosystem continues to empower the farming community and FPOs by delivering personalised and dynamic advisory services as well as hyperlocal offerings including market linkages, agri inputs and credit enablement. Further details on this transformative initiative are provided in the Agri Business section of this report.\\nThe Government of India had inspired the United Nations to declare 2023 as the ‘International Year of Millets’. This drew global attention to this ‘super-grain’ that has the potential to redefine agriculture with its unique value proposition. Millets are climate resilient crops using substantially lesser water than other staples and grow in half the time as other crops, offering a comprehensive solution for sustained nutrition and food\\xa0security.\\nYour Company has spearheaded ‘ITC Mission Millets’, leveraging its enterprise strengths in agriculture, food and hospitality to implement multi-dimensional interventions in this area. The holistic programme follows a strategic 3-fold approach – 1) developing a ‘good-for-you’ product portfolio, 2) implementing sustainable farming systems, and 3) enhancing consumer awareness through an Educate, Empower and Encourage approach. Your Company has implemented a focused strategy in crafting a millet-based products portfolio under its world-class Indian brands for every occasion, age and format. To cater to the diverse needs of consumers, your Company has launched products across traditional and modern formats viz. ‘Gluten Free Flour’, ‘Multi-Millet Batter Mix’, ‘Atta with Millets’ and ‘Ragi Flour’, Vermicelli, Biscuits, Snacks and Noodles under the ‘Aashirvaad’,‘Sunfeast’, ‘Bingo!’ and ‘YiPPee!’ brands. These are being progressively scaled up across target markets. Your Company has also designed products that suit every meal occasion like millet idlis for breakfast, biscuits & cookies for snacking and noodles & pasta for other meals. The\\xa0thrust on millets is further exemplified by the Hotels Business creating easy-to-try recipes with millets to help encourage individuals experiment with the taste and texture of millets. The first ever postal Report of the Board of Directors Your Company’s ITCMAARS (Metamarket for Advanced Agriculture and Rural Services) initiative continues to be scaled up rapidly and currently covers over 1.5 million farmers and over 1,650 FPOs, across 10 states and over 18,000 villages.\\nREPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 45 ITC Limited stamp to commemorate the year of millets and your Company’s unique Mission Millets initiative was also launched by the Department of Posts during the year.\\nIn line with your Company’s commitment to empower farmers, your Company has developed a millets agri-value chain with special thrust on enhancing value-addition and market linkages. Your Company is also promoting FPOs in millet farming anchored by ITCMAARS. The Agri Business has entered into a partnership with Indian Institute of Millets Research (IIMR), Hyderabad to promote high yielding varieties and advanced package of practices among millet farmers. Your Company remains committed to supporting the Government’s efforts to promote millets given their immense benefits in terms of nutritional properties and attributes as a planet friendly and climate resilient\\xa0crop.\\nIt is pertinent to note that a substantial quantum of food is wasted along the chain in India, depending on the season and the inherent perishability of the crop. Higher levels of food processing in the economy can create a much larger pull for quality agri-commodities, thereby reducing farm wastages and raising farm incomes. This would require focused investments in developing product-specific climate-controlled infrastructure as well as in branded products that benefit large agri-value chains. Corporate participation is essential not only to invest in requisite infrastructure, but also to provide assured market linkages to farmers. A big thrust on India’s Food Processing sector can play a pivotal role in this regard and have a large multiplier effect which will lead to significant job creation, enhance rural incomes and help manage food inflation in a sustainable manner. In this context, the PLI Scheme for the Food Processing sector is expected to play a critical role in boosting investments, agri exports, farmer incomes, employment generation and building Indian brands for the global market. Your Company has been included under the scheme for several of its Branded Packaged Foods Businesses and in the Agri Business, details of which are provided in the subsequent sections. Similarly, the Agro-forestry sector, as a source of raw material for wood-based industry, is woefully constrained by policies that not only impede job creation in India but also promote avoidable imports. Recent policy interventions to enable greening of wastelands and providing financial assistance to members of marginalised communities taking up Agro-forestry is a commendable starting point to reverse this situation. Supportive policies in this area would go a long way in enhancing sustainable livelihoods, augmenting alternative sources of energy (bio-fuel) and enabling import substitution for wood-based industries while simultaneously augmenting the Nation’s environmental capital. Your Company’s interventions across operating segments are aligned to the national priorities of enhancing competitiveness of Indian agriculture and industry, generating large-scale employment opportunities and supporting sustainable livelihoods, driving import substitution, creating national brands to maximise value capture in India, accelerating growth in tourism, increasing Indian agri exports and promoting sustainable business practices. Investments made by your Company continue to be guided by the national objectives of ‘Make in India’ and ‘Doubling Farmers’ Income’ and the overarching theme of ‘Aatma Nirbhar Bharat’ that seeks to make the country stronger, resilient and more competitive.\\nReport of the Board of Directors A big thrust on India’s Food Processing sector can play a pivotal role and have a large multiplier effect.

This phase focuses on internalising capability enhancement methodology for training of farmers as well as communicating the model village template amongst Government teams and agencies such as Krishi Vikas Kendras. During the year, over 12 lakh farmers were trained on package of practices for principal crops of the region as well as on livestock management, resulting in over 44 lakh cumulative farmer interactions. Similarly, Government has also initiated work on 8,000 model villages based on the activities demonstrated by your Company across 1,350 villages during the initial period of the partnership. Estimates indicate yield improvement of up to 30% for cotton, maize, paddy and soyabean in locations covered by the programme; similarly, cost of cultivation is estimated to have reduced by nearly 15%, resulting in expansion of farmer incomes by up\\xa0to 60%. Your Company is working towards developing village level institutions, promoting women agriculturists, facilitating cadre of women service providers like Pashu Sakhis, Yojana Sakhis, Krishi Sakhis and fostering micro entrepreneurship through Agri-Business Centres and Self-Help Groups. Custom hiring centres for farm mechanisation, post-harvest product management infrastructure and community managed seed banks for self-reliance in quality seed material are also being facilitated. Environmentally sustainable farm practices, including zero-till sowing of wheat, direct seeding of rice, micro-irrigation and watershed development, continue to be promoted. Your Company’s collaboration with CGIAR’s ‘Climate Change and Food Security Programme’ to build climate smart villages was expanded to 6,755 villages across 19 states covering nearly 19 lakh acres, supporting farmers in the management of risks arising from erratic and extreme weather events. Further, according to CGIAR’s estimates, your Company’s Climate Smart Village intervention in Madhya Pradesh demonstrated average increase in yield of 38% and 15% in soyabean and wheat respectively, over the baseline. Reduction in cost of cultivation along with yield improvement led to an increase in net income by 93% in soyabean and 46% in wheat over the baseline and average Green House Gas emissions reduced by 66% for soyabean and 13% for wheat as compared to the baseline. In villages where the intervention has been implemented for over three years, adoption rates for High-Yield and High-Resilience varieties have exceeded 70%, as against 20% in the baseline assessment.\\nIn Kapurthala District, Punjab, your Company under its flagship programme of ‘ITC Mission Sunehra Kal’ has, over the last six years, implemented solutions that have effectively substituted the burning of paddy stubble by farmers. During the year, the programme covered nearly 2.5 lakh acres with appx. 94% of the area (2.3 lakh acres) witnessing total stoppage of stubble burning, thereby avoiding appx. 1.8 lakh tonnes of carbon release into the atmosphere.\\nAlthough India accounts for appx. 18% of the world population, its share of natural resources is disproportionately low with only 2% of global land mass, 4% of freshwater resources and 2% of forest resources.

While India is the world’s second largest consumer of tobacco, legal cigarettes constitute only 9% of overall tobacco consumption in India, as against a global average of 90%. It is pertinent to note that India accounts for less than 2% of global cigarette consumption despite having 18% of the world’s population - making India’s per capita cigarette consumption amongst the lowest in the world.\\nOver the years, discriminatory and punitive taxation on cigarettes has led to progressive migration of consumption from duty-paid cigarettes to other lightly taxed/tax-evaded forms of tobacco products, comprising illicit cigarettes, bidi, chewing tobacco, gutkha, zarda, snuff, etc. It is pertinent to note that while the share of legal cigarettes in total tobacco consumption has declined from 21% in 1981-82 to a mere 9%, aggregate tobacco consumption in the country has increased over the same period. As a result, despite accounting for less than 1/10th of the tobacco consumed in the country, duty-paid cigarettes contribute more than 4/5th of the revenue generated from the tobacco sector. Taxes on cigarettes remain one of the highest in India as depicted in the chart: Report of the Board of Directors REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 51 ITC Limited Taxes on cigarettes in India are multiple times higher than in developed countries viz. 14x of USA, 7x of Japan, 6x of Germany and so on. Further, the same is also substantially higher than that in neighbouring\\xa0countries. It is pertinent to note that India’s per capita cigarette consumption is amongst the lowest in the world and is significantly lower compared to that of China, Japan, USA, UK and even neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh and Pakistan. Historically, steep increases in taxation have adversely impacted tax collections and legal cigarette volumes, while a stable tax regime has led to buoyancy in tax collections as evidenced in the table below: Period Increase in Tax Incidence Increase in Revenue Collections FY 2012-13 to FY 2016-17 (CAGR) 15.7% 4.7% Apr 2018 to Jan 2020 over Jul 2017 to Mar 2018 – 10.2% Oct 2020 to Mar 2021 over Aug 2019 to Jan 2020 13.0% 1.8% Apr 2022 to Jan 2023 over Oct 2021 to Mar 2022 – 11.1% Tax per 2000 Cigarettes as a percentage of Per Capita GDP USA India UK Pakistan Canada Thailand Australia Malaysia Russia China Germany Japan 0.40% 0.80% 1.00% 1.03% 1.13% 1.19% 1.50% 1.68% 2.11% 2.30% 2.75% 5.71% Source: Tax data – WHO Global Health Observatory, 2024 (Cigarette tax data for 2022); Per Capita GDP – World Bank (Data for the year 2022) No. of Cigarettes per annum Per Capita Consumption of Cigarettes Source: The Tobacco Atlas – 7th Edition, 2022 1971 1133 898 897 468 394 90 \" China Japan USA Bangladesh UK Pakistan India Punitive taxes on the legal cigarette industry in earlier years have resulted in rapid growth of illicit cigarette trade – making India the 4th largest illicit cigarette market globally according to Euromonitor estimates.\\nPunitive taxes on the legal cigarette industry in earlier years have resulted in rapid growth of illicit cigarette trade – making India the 4th largest illicit cigarette market globally according to Euromonitor estimates. Over the years this has created attractive tax arbitrage opportunities for unscrupulous players indulging in illicit cigarette trade. While legitimate cigarette industry volumes have declined consistently over the last decade, illicit cigarette volumes, in contrast, have grown rapidly during the same period, accounting for about 1/3rd of the legal industry. It is pertinent to note that the legal industry has been able to partially claw back volumes from illicit trade during periods of tax stability, backed by deterrent actions by enforcement agencies.\\nDuring the year, there were extensive media reports on the multitude of cases of evasion of taxes/duties by dealers in illicit cigarettes which were unearthed by raids conducted by Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) and other enforcement agencies. ‘Illicit markets: A Threat to Our National Interests’, a study published by FICCI-TARI in September 2022, noted that “The consumption of illegal cigarettes in India has increased, signalling a shift from legal products to cheaper substitutes or illicit products, which have no or little tax element in them. When taxes are raised beyond a certain optimum level, consumers gravitate towards cheaper alternatives or illicit supplies, which are normally smuggled or tax evaded goods”. It is estimated that illicit trade causes an annual revenue loss of appx. ` 21000 crores to the Exchequer. With respect to other tobacco products as well, the revenue losses are significant since about 68%1 of the total tobacco consumed in the country remains outside the tax net.\\nThe Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), in its report “Smuggling in India 2021-22” acknowledges the high incidence of taxes in India providing opportunities for illicit trade of cigarettes. The report states: “High Incidence of tax on cigarettes in India results in a tax arbitrage in favour of smuggled cigarettes on which no taxes are paid and there is no statutory requirement of pictorial warning covering at least 85 percent of the packaging space. More importantly, the smuggled cigarettes are, on an average, 50 percent cheaper in the Indian Market, compared to the price of any similar cigarette brand. From a public health perspective, the smuggling of cigarettes also poses a very serious challenge since a part of the smuggled cigarettes are counterfeits and the quality of tobacco and other ingredients used in the said cigarettes, is inferior.” Tobacco control measures in India have ranked amongst the most stringent in the world from the time of enactment of the Cigarettes (Regulation of Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 1975, to the present. India is also one of the few countries where tobacco products are regulated across the value chain\\xa0– from their manufacture to sale to consumers. The Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003 (COTPA) requires cigarette packages to display the statutorily mandated pictorial and textual warnings covering 85% of the surface area of the packet - one of the largest in the world. It may be observed that smuggled international brands of cigarettes do not bear any of the pictorial or textual warnings mandated by Indian laws or, bear much smaller pictorial/textual warnings as per the tobacco laws of the countries from where Report of the Board of Directors 52 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 ITC Limited 1 \\x07 Report on the impact of current tax framework on the tobacco sector in India and suggestions for its improvement - 2014, by ASSOCHAM and KPMG.

The illicit cigarette trade also has a deleterious impact on farmers and farm workers engaged in the tobacco value chain.\\nthese cigarettes\\xa0originate. As reported in prior years, findings from research conducted by IMRB International, an independent market research organisation, show that the lack of pictorial warnings on packets of smuggled international brands of cigarettes or their diminutive size creates a perception in the consumers’ mind that these illicit cigarettes are ‘safer’ than domestic duty-paid cigarettes that carry the 85% pictorial warnings. The combination of low prices to consumers due to tax evasion and the misleading perception created by the absence of statutory pictorial warnings provides significant buoyancy to illicit cigarette volumes.\\nIndia is among the top three tobacco growing countries in the world. Tobacco plays a significant role in the Indian economy on account of its considerable contribution to the agricultural, industrial and export sectors2. Illicit cigarette trade also has a deleterious impact on farmers and farm workers engaged in the tobacco value chain. In India, cigarettes are manufactured largely using Flue Cured Virginia (FCV) tobacco grown in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka. As smuggled international brands of cigarettes do not use Indian tobaccos, in addition to revenue losses, the growth of illicit cigarette trade has also resulted in a sharp drop in demand for Indian FCV tobaccos in the domestic market. FCV tobacco production has dropped by ~40% between 2013-14 and 2021-22, resulting in shrinkage in earnings and loss of an estimated 35 million man-days of employment in tobacco growing areas.\\nIt is pertinent to note that several other major tobacco producing countries, including the USA, have established regulatory frameworks taking into consideration the economic interests of their tobacco farmers. The punitive and discriminatory taxation & regulatory regime on cigarettes in India over the years, has adversely affected the livelihood of Indian tobacco farmers with corresponding gains to those countries that have opted for moderate and equitable tobacco regulations. These developments, coupled with lower availability of Indian crop, lower export incentives in India and relative weakness of currencies in certain competing geographies have, in the past, had a debilitating impact on millions of livelihoods, dependent on the tobacco value chain in India. This has been exacerbated by global crop shortages due to extreme weather events and supply chain disruptions on account of geopolitical developments. However, recent stability in taxes on cigarettes backed by deterrent actions of enforcement agencies has enabled the legal cigarette industry to combat illicit trade and claw back volumes, thereby generating domestic and export demand for Indian tobaccos. As reported in earlier years, your Company and several other stakeholders had challenged the validity of the pictorial and textual warning covering 85% of the surface area of the packet prescribed under COTPA. The Honourable Karnataka High Court, by its judgement in December, 2017, held the 85% pictorial warnings to be factually incorrect and unconstitutional. Upon Special Leave Petitions filed by the Government and others, the Honourable Supreme Court has stayed the judgment of the High Court. The cases are pending before the Honourable Supreme Court. The extremely stringent regulations along with the discriminatory and steep taxation on cigarettes Report of the Board of Directors REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 53 ITC Limited 2 \\x07 Report on Tobacco Control in India, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, GoI, 2004 (Jointly supported by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA and the World Health Organisation).\\nRecent stability in taxes on cigarettes backed by deterrent actions of enforcement agencies has enabled the legal cigarette industry to combat illicit trade and claw back volumes, thereby generating domestic and export demand for Indian tobaccos.\\nhave had numerous negative, albeit unintended repercussions. These include: – rapid growth in illicit cigarette volumes, which resulted in sub-optimisation of the revenue potential of the tobacco sector and significant loss to the Exchequer. It is estimated that on account of illicit cigarettes alone, revenue loss to the Government is appx. ` 21000 crores per annum. – widespread availability of illicit cigarettes and other tobacco products of dubious quality and hygiene to consumers at extremely affordable prices. As a result, despite accounting for less than 1/10th of the tobacco consumed in the country, duty-paid cigarettes contribute more than 4/5th of the revenue generated from the tobacco\\xa0sector.\\n– a large component of tobacco consumption in the country, aggregating around 68%, remaining outside the tax net. – persistent negative impact on the livelihood of tobacco farmers and others dependent on tobacco. Studies by the Central Tobacco Research Institute (CTRI) indicate that on account of agro-climatic conditions, there is no equally remunerative alternate crop that can be grown in the FCV tobacco growing regions of the country.\\nYour Company continues to engage with policy makers for a framework of pragmatic, equitable, non-discriminatory, evidence-based regulations and taxation policies that balance the economic imperatives of the country and tobacco control objectives, cognising for the unique tobacco consumption pattern in India. Stability in taxes is critical to address the interests of all stakeholders of this industry, including tobacco farmers, consumers and the Exchequer.\\nManufacturing facilities of the Business continue to be modernised by inducting contemporary technologies to drive innovation and secure higher levels of productivity and product excellence.

In the backdrop of global volatility, RBI towards end of September’23 took steps to tighten liquidity conditions in the Banking system which reversed the trajectory of domestic interest rates.

Periods of INR weakness was attributed mostly to global factors such as escalation of conflict in the Middle East and US Federal Reserve adopting a ‘higher for longer’ monetary policy stance to meet its mandate of lowering inflation. RBI’s strategic intervention in the forex markets which gained prominence from September’23, enabled reduction in market volatility.\\nTo effectively navigate the volatility in currency markets, your Company adopted a proactive risk management strategy and actively managed foreign 128 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 ITC Limited Report of the Board of Directors currency exposures through appropriate hedging strategies and market instruments to protect business\\xa0margins.

It is now universally evident that enterprises of the future will not only have to be agile, consumer-centric, innovative and digital-first but also purpose-driven and responsibly competitive. Your Company’s superordinate goal of serving larger national priorities and creating value for all stakeholders has evolved into a new paradigm - ‘Responsible Competitiveness’ - that focuses on extreme competitiveness but in a manner that replenishes the environment and supports sustainable livelihoods. 134 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 ITC Limited Report of the Board of Directors The strategic Vision of creating multiple drivers of growth through the pursuit of market opportunities that best match institutional strengths, has resulted in the development of strong Businesses of the future anchored on a portfolio of purpose-led brands, future-ready products and world-class quality. Today, your Company is the leading FMCG marketer in India, a pre-eminent hotel chain and a globally acclaimed icon in green hoteliering, the clear market leader in the Indian Paperboards and Packaging industry, a pioneering trailblazer in farmer and rural empowerment through its Agri Business and a global exemplar in sustainable business practices. Since the turn of the millennium, your Company’s non-cigarettes businesses have grown over 31-fold and presently constitute about two-thirds of Net Segment Revenue. At the heart of this transformation lies the power of synergy, with seamless access for your Company’s new Businesses/initiatives to the deep and varied capabilities resident across different parts of the enterprise, and its world-class talent pool. An extensive strategy reset has been undertaken in recent years to architect the structural drivers that will power the ITC Next strategy of building a Future-Ready, Consumer-Centric, Climate Positive and Inclusive organisation anchored on the Responsible Competitiveness paradigm. In recent years, the FMCG Businesses have delivered strong revenue growth along with significant margin expansion and are well poised to be rapidly scaled up. Multi-dimensional interventions have been made to strengthen the FMCG Businesses for sustained profitable growth. The product portfolio of your Company has been further strengthened in alignment with new opportunities and enterprise strengths with sharper focus on fortifying the core businesses, addressing adjacent opportunities leveraging Mother Brands and building emerging businesses for the future. To accentuate consumer-centricity, agility and enable sharper focus in the context of the growing scale and complexity of operations, the Branded Packaged Foods Businesses have been reorganised into product market centric clusters with integrated and empowered teams. Focused interventions made in the recent past have also augmented your Company’s multi-channel go-to-market capability, resulting in manifold expansion in the reach and availability of its products. Over the last five years, market and outlet coverage have grown 2.5x and 1.4x respectively while the network of stockists has expanded to 8x during the same period. Sharp-focused investments have augmented capability in emerging channels such as e-Commerce and Modern Trade, resulting in strong growth in sales and enhanced market standing. In addition, investments towards accelerating agile and purposeful innovation, optimising supply chain efficiencies, accelerated digital adoption, and strategic partnerships have significantly enhanced competitiveness. The impact of these multi-dimensional interventions is evident in the substantial margin expansion of 560 bps in Segment EBITDA over the last five years even in the face of severe inflationary headwinds. The FMCG Businesses will continue to leverage your Company’s institutional strengths as a key source of sustainable competitive advantage viz. strong backward linkages with the Agri Business, a deep & wide multi-channel distribution network, cuisine knowledge resident in the Hotels Business, packaging knowhow and the robust R&D platforms nurtured by LSTC. Structural advantages arising out of distributed manufacturing footprint, anchored on state-of-the-art ICMLs strategically located proximal to large demand centres, will be increasingly leveraged to drive rapid growth of the FMCG Businesses. With enhanced scale and margin expansion, the FMCG Businesses are expected to make increasingly higher contributions to your Company’s profit pool, thereby setting the stage for further value enhancement opportunities.\\nThe Agri Business has been a strong backbone and a key source of competitive advantage for your Company’s FMCG and Cigarettes Businesses. The\\xa0scope and scale of operations have grown manifold over the years and currently encompass nearly 3 million tonnes of annual volume throughput in 22 states and over 20 agri-value chains. In recent REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 135 ITC Limited Report of the Board of Directors years, the Business has pivoted its strategic focus towards rapidly scaling up its Value-Added Agri Products portfolio to accelerate growth and margins. With policy enablers in place, your Company is developing NextGen agriculture value chains that are digitally enabled and climate smart, and re-structuring the back end into a robust network of Farmer Producer Organisations. This will further strengthen the sourcing network and facilitate the development of customised supply chains for traceable and identity-preserved sourcing of agri-commodities and in augmenting the product portfolio with the addition of value-added products such as staples for the Food Service segment, fresh and frozen fruits & vegetables, medicinal and aromatic plant extracts etc. Towards enhancing the competitiveness of domestic agri-value chains, fostering new business models and augmenting value creation opportunities, your Company has successfully scaled up ITCMAARS – a crop-agnostic ‘phygital’ full stack AgriTech platform integrating NextGen agri-technologies and solutions – to seamlessly deliver hyperlocal and personalised solutions to the farming community whilst creating new and scalable revenue streams and strengthening sourcing efficiencies.\\nThe Paperboards, Paper and Packaging Businesses have made significant progress in recent years in terms of enhanced scale and profitability improvement. Strategic investments have been stepped up in areas such as pulp import substitution, proactive capacity augmentation in Value-Added Paperboards segment, decarbonisation of operations, deployment of Industry 4.0 technologies and towards nurturing robust innovation platforms. The focus going forward is to fortify market leadership in the fast-growing Value-Added Paperboards segment by augmenting scale, driving cutting-edge innovation to rapidly scale-up single use plastic substitutes as a new vector of growth, building structural advantage through product mix enrichment and scaling up the use of emergent technologies such as Industry 4.0 to enhance operational efficiency, reduce wastage and\\xa0costs.\\nThe Hotels Business has over the years established a strong footprint of iconic properties and F&B brands on the back of an investment-led growth strategy. In recent years, the strategy has been reset to pursue an ‘asset-right’ growth path and augment revenue streams while simultaneously leveraging your Company’s world-class properties and iconic cuisine brands to drive growth. Investments have been stepped up to harness the power of Digital to enhance guest experience, efficiency and productivity across all nodes of the value chain. As stated in earlier years, your Company had been evaluating alternate structures for the Hotels Business to enable the next horizon of growth and value creation. In furtherance of this strategy, during the year, the Board of Directors of your Company, approved a Scheme of Arrangement amongst your Company and ITC Hotels Limited providing, inter alia, for demerger of the Hotels Business of your Company into ITC Hotels Limited. While the Stock Exchanges have given their respective No-Objections, the Scheme is subject to other requisite approvals including approval of the National Company Law Tribunal, Kolkata Bench.\\nYour Company continues to build a dynamic ‘Future-Tech’ enterprise powered by state-of-the-art digital technologies and infrastructure (‘Mission DigiArc’) across the value chain adding significant impetus to digital marketing, digital commerce, digital products and digital operations.

Disruptive business models and value propositions anchored at the intersection of future frontiers of Digitalisation and Sustainability form an integral part of your Company’s strategic roadmap going forward. NextGen business models such as ITCMAARS in the agri-ecosystem, tech-enabled cloud kitchens in the food service space, sustainable paperboards and packaging solutions customised for end-use with focus on single use plastic substitutes, are being piloted/progressed to actualise these opportunities. Value-accretive acquisitions, joint venture and collaborations continue to be proactively pursued towards accelerating growth and value creation.\\nThe global operating environment has become increasingly complex, uncertain and volatile. In the wake of several upheavals witnessed over the last few years, there is now a spectre of ‘permacrisis’ i.e. an extended period of crisis from a series of extremely disruptive events, viz. pandemic, extreme weather events caused by climate change, geopolitical tensions, severe inflationary pressures. This is exacerbated by the phenomenon of ‘polycrisis’, signifying simultaneous occurrence of several crises. India remains one of the few bright spots in an increasingly volatile and unpredictable world. With structural drivers of growth firmly in place, India is firmly positioned to play a larger role on the global stage going forward. Your Company, with its robust and dynamic strategy pillars as aforestated, is well poised to rapidly scale-up and enhance its market standing across operating segments.\\nThe resilience, agility and adaptive capacity demonstrated by your Company is a testament to the talent, determination and untiring efforts of its pool of dedicated professionals, associates and partners. Your Company’s diverse talent pool of professional entrepreneurs, ‘proneurs’, have the unique opportunity to nurture categories, products and brands from ideation to execution. This talent pool is being harnessed not only to create winning products and services for today, but also to seize larger opportunities as they emerge from the expanding horizons of your Company’s Businesses.\\nYour Company’s Board and employees are inspired by the Vision of sustaining your Company’s position as one of India’s most admired and valuable companies, creating enduring value for all stakeholders, including the shareholders and the Indian society.

SINGHI\\x08 Company Secretary (Membership No.: FCS 3770) * Also refer Note 28(ix) 170 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 ITC Limited 1. Material Accounting Policies Statement of Compliance These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 and amendments thereto. The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with the relevant presentation requirements of the Companies Act, 2013. The Company adopted Ind AS from 1st April, 2016.\\nBasis of Preparation The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention, except for certain items that are measured at amortised cost or fair value, as explained in the accounting policies.\\nFair Value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Company takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and / or disclosure purposes in these financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for share-based payment transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 102 – Share-based Payment, leasing transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 116 – Leases, and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net realisable value in Ind AS 2 – Inventories or value in use in Ind AS 36 – Impairment of Assets.\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period; they are recognised in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\\nOperating Cycle All assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-current as per the Company’s normal operating cycle and other criteria set out in the Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013 and Ind AS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements based on the nature of products and the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents. The Company has identified twelve months as its operating cycle.\\nProperty, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment (PP&E) are stated at cost of acquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment, if any. For this purpose, cost includes deemed cost which represents the carrying value of PP&E recognised as at 1st April, 2015 measured as per the previous Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).\\nCost is inclusive of inward freight, duties and taxes and incidental expenses related to acquisition. In respect of major projects involving construction, related pre-operational expenses form part of the value of assets capitalised. Expenses capitalised also include applicable borrowing costs for qualifying assets, if any. All upgradation / enhancements are charged off as revenue expenditure unless they bring similar significant additional benefits. An item of PP&E is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of PP&E is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss.\\nDepreciation of these assets commences when the assets are ready for their intended use, which is generally on commissioning. Items of PP&E are depreciated in a manner that amortizes the cost (or other amount substituted for cost) of the assets after commissioning, less its residual value, over their useful lives as specified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 on a straight-line basis. Land is not depreciated.\\nCompany Information ITC Limited (the ‘Company’) [CIN: L16005WB1910PLC001985] is a public limited company domiciled in India with its registered office located at Virginia House, 37 Jawaharlal Nehru Road, Kolkata 700 071. The Company’s shares are listed on the National Stock Exchange of India Limited, BSE Limited and The Calcutta Stock Exchange Limited. The Company is a diversified conglomerate with businesses spanning Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (Cigarettes & Cigars, Foods, Personal Care Products, Education & Stationery Products, Safety Matches and Agarbattis), Hotels, Paperboards, Paper and Packaging, and Agri Business.\\nNotes to the Standalone Financial Statements REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 171 ITC Limited 1. Material Accounting Policies (Contd.) The estimated useful lives of PP&E of the Company are as follows: Buildings 30-60 Years Leasehold Improvements Shorter of lease period or estimated useful lives Plant and Equipment 3-25 Years Furniture and Fixtures 8-10 Years Vehicles 8-10 Years Office Equipment 5 Years PP&E’s residual values, useful lives and method of depreciation are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and changes, if any, are treated as changes in accounting estimate. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill arising on Business Combination is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is annually tested for impairment. Impairment loss, if any, to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount is charged off to the Statement of Profit and Loss as it arises and is not reversed. For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to Cash Generating Unit (CGU) or group of CGUs to which it relates, which is not larger than an operating segment, and is monitored for internal management purposes.\\nOn disposal of the CGU or group of CGUs, attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\\nOther Intangible Assets Other Intangible Assets that the Company controls and from which it expects future economic benefits are capitalised upon acquisition and measured initially: a. for assets acquired in a business combination, at fair value on the date of acquisition. b. for separately acquired assets, at cost comprising the purchase price (including import duties and non-refundable taxes) and directly attributable costs to prepare the asset for its intended use.\\nInternally generated assets for which the cost is clearly identifiable are capitalised at cost. Research expenditure is recognised as an expense when it is incurred. Development costs are capitalised only after the technical and commercial feasibility of the asset for sale or use has been established. Thereafter, all directly attributable expenditure incurred to prepare the asset for its intended use are recognised as the cost of such assets. Internally generated brands, websites and customer lists are not recognised as intangible assets. The carrying value of intangible assets includes deemed cost which represents the carrying value of intangible assets recognised as at 1st April, 2015 measured as per the previous GAAP.\\nAfter initial recognition, an intangible asset is carried at its cost less accumulated amortization and\\u2009/ or impairment losses.\\nThe useful life of an intangible asset is considered finite where the rights to such assets are limited to a specified period of time by contract or law (e.g. patents, licences, trademarks, franchise and servicing rights) or the likelihood of technical, technological obsolescence (e.g. computer software, design, prototypes) or commercial obsolescence (e.g. lesser known brands are those to which adequate marketing support may not be provided). If, there are no such limitations, the useful life is taken to be indefinite.\\nIntangible assets that have finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives by the straight-line method unless it is practical to reliably determine the pattern of benefits arising from the asset. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized. However, it is annually tested for impairment. Amortization expenses and impairment losses and reversal of impairment losses are included in the ‘Depreciation and amortization expense’ in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The estimated useful lives of intangible assets of the Company with finite lives are as follows: Trademarks / Know How, Business and Commercial Rights 10 Years (unless shorter useful life is required based on contractual or legal terms) Computer Software 5 Years Customer Relationships 8 Years The useful lives of intangible assets are reviewed annually to determine if a reset of such useful life is required for assets with finite lives and to confirm that business circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life assessment for assets so classified. Based on such review, the useful life may change or the useful life assessment may change from indefinite to finite. The impact of such changes is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate. Investment Property Properties that are held for long-term rental yields and / or for capital appreciation are classified as investment properties. Investment properties are stated at cost of acquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Depreciation is recognised using the straight line method so as to amortise the cost of investment properties over their useful lives as specified in Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 172 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 ITC Limited Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013. Freehold land and properties under construction are not depreciated. Transfers to, or from, investment properties are made at the carrying amount when and only when there is a change in use. An item of investment property is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of investment property is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the property and is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\\nIncome received from investment property is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\\nImpairment of Assets Impairment loss, if any, is provided to the extent, the carrying amount of assets or cash generating units exceeds their recoverable amount.\\nRecoverable amount is higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset or cash generating unit and from its disposal at the end of its useful life. Impairment losses recognised in prior years are reversed when there is an indication that the impairment losses recognised no longer exist or have decreased. Such reversals are recognised as an increase in carrying amounts of assets to the extent that it does not exceed the carrying amounts that would have been determined (net of amortization or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised in previous years. Inventories Inventories are stated at lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost is calculated on weighted average method. Cost comprises expenditure incurred in the normal course of business in bringing such inventories to their present location and condition and includes, where applicable, appropriate overheads based on normal level of activity. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs for completion and sale.\\nObsolete, slow moving and defective inventories are identified from time to time and, where necessary, a provision is made for such inventories. Foreign Currency Transactions The functional and presentation currency of the Company is Indian Rupee.\\nTransactions in foreign currency are accounted for at the exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date. Gains\\u2009/\\u2009losses arising on settlement as also on translation of monetary items are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\\nExchange differences arising on monetary items that, in substance, form part of the Company’s net investment in a foreign operation (having a functional currency other than Indian Rupee) are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in Foreign Currency Translation Reserve. Derivatives and Hedge Accounting Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gains\\u2009/\\u2009losses are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which case the resulting gain /\\u2009loss is recognised as per the hedge accounting principles stated below.\\nThe Company complies with the principles of hedge accounting where derivative contracts and\\u2009/\\u2009or non-derivative financial assets / liabilities that are permitted under applicable accounting standards are designated as hedging instruments. At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Company documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with the risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking hedge transaction, which can be a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge.\\n(i) Fair value hedges Changes in fair value of the designated portion of hedging instruments that qualify as fair value hedges are recognised in profit or loss immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. Such fair value changes are recognised in the line item relating to the hedged item in Statement of Profit and Loss. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument is derecognised, expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortised to profit or loss from that date.\\n(ii)\\tCash flow hedges The effective portion of changes in the fair value of hedging instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in the other comprehensive income and accumulated as ‘Cash Flow Hedge Reserve’. The gains / losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\\n1. Material Accounting Policies (Contd.) Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 173 ITC Limited Amounts previously recognised and accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged item affects the Statement of Profit and Loss. However, when the hedged item results in the recognition of a non – financial asset, such gains / losses are transferred from equity (but not as reclassification adjustment) and included in the initial measurement cost of the non–financial asset. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument is derecognised, expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gains\\u2009/\\u2009losses recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity at that time remain in equity and is reclassified when the underlying transaction is ultimately recognised. When an underlying transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gains\\u2009/\\u2009losses accumulated in equity are recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\\nInvestment in Subsidiaries, Associates and Joint Ventures Investment in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are carried at cost less accumulated impairment, if any. Financial instruments, Financial assets, Financial liabilities and Equity Instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the relevant instrument and are initially measured at fair value except for trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component, which are measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value on initial recognition of financial assets or financial liabilities. Purchase or sale of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date when the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset. Financial Assets Recognition: Financial assets include Investments, Trade Receivables, Advances, Security Deposits, Cash and Cash equivalents. Such assets are initially recognised at fair value or transaction price, as applicable, when the Company becomes party to contractual obligations. The transaction price includes transaction costs unless the asset is being fair valued through the Statement of Profit and Loss. Classification: Management determines the classification of an asset at initial recognition depending on the purpose for which the assets were acquired. The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on such classification.\\nFinancial assets are classified as those measured at: (a)\\tamortised cost, where the financial assets are held solely for collection of cash flows arising from payments of principal and / or interest. (b)\\tfair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI), where the financial assets are held not only for collection of cash flows arising from payments of principal and interest but also from the sale of such assets. Such assets are subsequently measured at fair value, with unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value being recognised in other comprehensive income. (c)\\tfair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), where the assets are managed in accordance with an approved investment strategy that triggers purchase and sale decisions based on the fair value of such assets. Such assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value, including interest income and dividend income, if any, are recognised in ‘other income’ in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they arise.\\nTrade Receivables, Advances, Security Deposits, Cash and Cash equivalents etc. are classified for measurement at amortised cost while investments may fall under any of the aforesaid classes. However, in respect of particular investments in equity instruments that would otherwise be measured at fair value through profit or loss, an irrevocable election at initial recognition may be made to present subsequent changes in fair value through other comprehensive income.\\nImpairment: The Company assesses at each reporting date whether a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) such as investments, trade receivables, advances and security deposits held at amortised cost and financial assets that are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are tested for impairment based on evidence or information that is available without undue cost or effort. Expected credit losses are assessed and loss allowances recognised if the credit quality of the financial asset has deteriorated significantly since initial recognition. Reclassification: When and only when the business model is changed, the Company shall reclassify all affected financial assets prospectively from the reclassification date as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss without restating the previously recognised 1. Material Accounting Policies (Contd.) Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 174 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 ITC Limited gains, losses or interest and in terms of the reclassification principles laid down in the Ind AS relating to Financial Instruments. Derecognition: Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash flows from the assets has expired, or has been transferred, and the Company has transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. Concomitantly, if the asset is one that is measured at: (a)\\tamortised cost, the gain or loss is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss; (b)\\tfair value through other comprehensive income, the cumulative fair value adjustments previously taken to reserves are reclassified to the Statement of Profit and Loss unless the asset represents an equity investment, in which case the cumulative fair value adjustments previously taken to reserves are reclassified within equity. Income Recognition: Interest income is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the right to receive dividend is established.\\nFinancial Liabilities Borrowings, trade payables and other financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Any discount or premium on redemption\\u2009/\\u2009settlement is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss as finance cost over the life of the liability using the effective interest method and adjusted to the liability figure disclosed in the Balance Sheet. Financial liabilities are derecognised when the liability is extinguished, that is, when the contractual obligation is discharged, cancelled or on expiry. Offsetting Financial Instruments Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is included in the Balance Sheet where there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\\nEquity Instruments Equity instruments are recognised at the value of the proceeds, net of direct costs of the capital issue.\\nRevenue Revenue is measured at the transaction price that the Company receives or expects to receive as consideration for goods supplied and services rendered, net of returns and estimates of variable consideration such as discounts to customers. Revenue from the sale of goods includes Excise Duties and National Calamity Contingent Duty which are payable on manufacture of goods but excludes taxes such as VAT and Goods and Services Tax which are payable in respect of sale of goods and services.\\nRevenue from the sale of goods and services is recognised when the Company performs its obligations to its customers and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and recovery of the consideration is probable. The timing of such recognition in case of sale of goods is when the control over the same is transferred to the customer, which is mainly upon delivery and in case of services, in the period in which such services are rendered.\\nGovernment Grant The Company may receive government grants that require compliance with certain conditions related to the Company’s operating activities or are provided to the Company by way of financial assistance on the basis of certain qualifying criteria. Government grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received upon the Company complying with the conditions attached to the grant. Accordingly, government grants: (a)\\trelated to or used for assets, are deducted from the carrying amount of the asset.\\n(b)\\trelated to incurring specific expenditures are taken to the Statement of Profit and Loss on the same basis and in the same periods as the expenditures incurred.\\n(c)\\tby way of financial assistance on the basis of certain qualifying criteria are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss as they become receivable. In the unlikely event that a grant previously recognised is ultimately not received, it is treated as a change in estimate and the amount cumulatively recognised is expensed in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Dividend Distribution Dividends paid (including income tax thereon, if any) are recognised in the period in which the interim dividends are approved by the Board of Directors, or in respect of the final dividend when approved by shareholders.\\nEmployee Benefits Short-term employee benefits are expensed in the period in which the employee renders the related service on an undiscounted basis. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid within twelve months, if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay the same as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be reliably estimated.\\nThe Company makes contributions to both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes which are mainly administered through duly constituted and approved Trusts.\\nProvident Fund contributions are in the nature of defined contribution scheme. In respect of employees who 1. Material Accounting Policies (Contd.) Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 175 ITC Limited are members of constituted and approved trusts, the Company recognises contribution payable to such trusts as an expense including any shortfall in interest between the amount of interest realised by the investment and the interest payable to members at the rate declared by the Government of India. In respect of other employees, provident funds are deposited with the Government and recognised as expense. The Company makes contribution to defined contribution pension plan. The contribution payable is recognised as an expense, when an employee renders the related service. The Company also makes contribution to defined benefit pension and gratuity plan. The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuary using the projected unit credit method. Service costs and net interest expense or income is reflected in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Gain or Loss on account of remeasurements are recognised immediately through other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.\\nThe employees of the Company are entitled to compensated leave for which the Company records the liability based on actuarial valuation computed using projected unit credit method. These benefits are unfunded.\\nActual disbursements made under the Workers’ Voluntary Retirement Scheme are accounted as revenue expenses.\\nEmployee Share Based Compensation Stock Options Stock Options are granted to eligible employees under the ITC Employee Stock Option Schemes (“ITC ESOS”), as may be decided by the Nomination & Compensation Committee\\u2009/\\u2009Board. Eligible employees for this purpose include employees of the Company including Directors and those on deputation and employees of the Company’s subsidiary companies including Managing Director\\u2009/ Wholetime Director of a subsidiary.\\nUnder Ind AS, the cost of ITC Stock Options (Stock Options) is recognised based on the fair value of Stock Options as on the grant date. The fair value of Stock Options granted is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss over the period in which the performance and\\u2009/\\u2009or service conditions are fulfilled for employees of the Company (other than those out on deputation). The value of Stock Options, net of reimbursements, granted to employees on deputation and to employees of the wholly owned and other subsidiary companies is considered as capital contribution / investment. The Company generally seeks reimbursement of the value of Stock Options from such companies, as applicable. It may, if so recommended by the Corporate Management Committee and approved by the Audit Committee, decide not to seek such reimbursements from: (a)\\twholly owned subsidiaries who need to conserve financial capacity to sustain their business and growth plans and to address contingencies that may arise, taking into account the economic and market conditions then prevailing and opportunities and threats in the competitive context.\\n(b)\\tother companies not covered under (a) above, who need to conserve financial capacity to sustain their business and growth plans and where the quantum of reimbursement is not material - the materiality threshold being ` 5 Crores for each entity for a financial year. Cash Settled Stock Appreciation Linked Reward (SAR) Plan Cash Settled SAR units are granted to eligible employees under the ITC Employee Cash Settled Stock Appreciation Linked Reward Plan (“ITC ESARP”). The eligible employees for this purpose are such present and future permanent employees of the Company, including a Director of the Company, as may be decided by the CMC / Nomination & Compensation Committee / Board. For cash settled SAR units granted to eligible employees, a liability is initially measured at fair value at the grant date and is subsequently remeasured at each reporting period, until settled. The fair value of ESAR units granted is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss over the period in which the performance and\\u2009/\\u2009or service conditions are fulfilled for employees of the Company. In case of employees on deputation to group companies, the Company generally seeks reimbursements from the concerned group company. The value of such payments, net of reimbursements, is considered as capital contribution / investment. Leases The Company assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\\nCompany as a Lessee Right-of-Use (ROU) assets are recognised at inception of a contract or arrangement for significant lease components at cost less lease incentives, if any. ROU assets are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. The cost of ROU assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct cost incurred and lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date. ROU assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and estimated useful lives of the underlying assets on a straight line basis. Lease term is determined based on consideration of facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not to 1. Material Accounting Policies (Contd.) Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 176 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 ITC Limited exercise a termination option. Lease payments associated with short-term leases (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option) and low value leases (i.e., where the value of the underlying asset, when new, in order of magnitude is ` 5 lakhs or less) are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.\\nThe Company recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made on the date of recognition of the lease. Such lease liabilities do not include variable lease payments (that do not depend on an index or a rate), which are recognised as expense in the periods in which they are incurred. Interest on lease liability is recognised using the effective interest method. Lease liabilities are subsequently increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. The carrying amount of lease liabilities is also remeasured upon modification of lease arrangement or upon change in the assessment of the lease term. The effect of such remeasurements is adjusted to the value of the ROU assets.\\nCompany as a Lessor Leases in which the Company does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset are classified as operating leases. Where the Company is a lessor under an operating lease, the asset is capitalised within property, plant and equipment or investment property and depreciated over its useful economic life. Payments received under operating leases are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.\\nTaxes on Income Taxes on income comprise current taxes and deferred taxes. Current tax in the Statement of Profit and Loss is provided as the amount of tax payable in respect of taxable income for the period using tax rates and tax laws enacted during the period, together with any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the amounts used for taxation purposes (tax base), at the tax rates and tax laws enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax assets are recognised for the future tax consequences to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised.\\nIncome tax, insofar as it relates to items disclosed under other comprehensive income or equity, is disclosed separately under other comprehensive income or equity, as applicable.\\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\\nClaims Claims against the Company not acknowledged as debts are disclosed after a careful evaluation of the facts and legal aspects of the matter involved.\\nProvisions Provisions are recognised when, as a result of a past event, the Company has a legal or constructive obligation; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount can be reliably estimated. The amount so recognised is a best estimate of the consideration required to settle the obligation at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.\\nIn an event when the time value of money is material, the provision is carried at the present value of the cash flows estimated to settle the obligation.\\nOperating Segments Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker (CODM). The CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Corporate Management Committee. Segments are organised based on businesses which have similar economic characteristics as well as exhibit similarities in nature of products and services offered, the nature of production processes, the type and class of customer and distribution methods.\\nSegment revenue arising from third party customers is reported on the same basis as revenue in the financial statements. Inter-segment revenue is reported on the basis of transactions which are primarily market led. Segment results represent profits before finance charges, unallocated corporate expenses and taxes. “Unallocated Corporate Expenses” include revenue and expenses that relate to initiatives / costs attributable to the enterprise as a whole.\\nFinancial and Management Information Systems The Company’s Accounting System is designed to unify the Financial and Cost Records and also to comply with the relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, to provide financial and cost information appropriate to the businesses and facilitate Internal Control.\\nNotes to the Standalone Financial Statements 1. Material Accounting Policies (Contd.) REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 177 ITC Limited Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 2. Use of estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the results of operations during the reporting period end. Although these estimates are based upon management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results could differ from these estimates.\\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\\nA. Judgements in applying accounting policies The judgements, apart from those involving estimations (see note B below), that the Company has made in the process of applying its accounting policies and that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in these financial statements pertain to useful life of intangible assets. The Company is required to determine whether its intangible assets have indefinite or finite life which is a subject matter of judgement. Certain trademarks have been considered of having an indefinite useful life taking into account that there are no technical, technological or commercial risks of obsolescence or limitations under contract or law. Other trademarks have been amortised over their useful economic life. Refer notes to the financial statements. B. Key sources of estimation uncertainty The following are the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. 1. \\x07 Useful lives of property, plant and equipment, investment property and intangible assets: \\x07 As described in the material accounting policies, the Company reviews the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment, investment property and intangible assets at the end of each reporting period and the impact of changes in the estimated useful life is considered in the period in which the estimate is revised. 2. \\x07 Fair value measurements and valuation processes: \\x07 Some of the Company’s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value for financial reporting purposes. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Company uses market-observable data to the extent it is available. Where Level 1 inputs are not available, the Company engages third party valuers, where required, to perform the valuation. Information about the valuation techniques and inputs used in determining the fair value of various assets, liabilities and share based payments are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. 3. \\x07 Actuarial Valuation: \\x07 The determination of Company’s liability towards defined benefit obligation to employees is made through independent actuarial valuation including determination of amounts to be recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss and in Other Comprehensive Income. Such valuation depends upon assumptions determined after taking into account inflation, seniority, promotion and other relevant factors such as supply and demand factors in the employment market. Information about such valuation is provided in notes to the financial statements. 4. \\x07 Claims, Provisions and Contingent Liabilities: \\x07 The Company has ongoing litigations with various regulatory authorities and third parties. Where an outflow of funds is believed to be probable and a reliable estimate of the outcome of the dispute can be made based on management’s assessment of specific circumstances of each dispute and relevant external advice, management provides for its best estimate of the liability. Such accruals are by nature complex and can take number of years to resolve and can involve estimation uncertainty. Information about such litigations is provided in notes to the financial statements.\\n178 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 ITC Limited (` in Crores) (` in Crores) Notes: 1. a) The above includes following assets given on operating lease: b) The amount of expenditure recognised in the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment in the course of construction is ` 129.01 Crores (2023 - ` 90.50 Crores).\\n2.

The fair value has been determined on the basis of valuation carried out at the reporting date by registered valuer as defined under rule 2 of Companies (Registered Valuers and Valuation) Rules, 2017 and the same has been categorised as Level 2 based on the valuation techniques used and inputs applied. The main inputs considered by the valuer are government rates, property location, market research & trends, contracted rentals, terminal yields, discount rates and comparable values, as appropriate. Amounts recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in respect of the investment property is as under: 4. Assets with indefinite life pertain to the ‘FMCG - Others’ Segment and are related to the Branded Packaged Foods and Personal Care Products businesses of the Company. Impairment testing for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives has been carried out considering their recoverable amounts which, inter-alia, includes estimation of their value-in-use based on management projections. These projections have been made for a period of five years, or longer, as applicable and consider various factors, such as market scenario, growth trends, growth and margin projections, and terminal growth rates specific to the business. For such projections, discount rate of 10% (2023 - 10%) and long-term growth rates ranging between 5% to 6% (2023 - 5% to 6%) have been considered. Discount rate has been determined considering the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) of market benchmarks. Based on the above assessment, no impairment has been recognised during the year. Further, the Company has also performed sensitivity analysis around the base assumptions and has concluded that there are no reasonably possible changes to key assumptions that would cause the carrying amount of the aforesaid assets to exceed their recoverable values.\\nParticulars For the year ended 31st March, 2024 For the year ended 31st March, 2023 Rental Income etc. from investment property 138.90 124.05 Direct Operating Expenses arising from investment property that generated rental income during the year$ 14.75 11.42 Direct Operating Expenses arising from investment property that did not generate rental income during the year – – (` in Crores) Particulars Depreciation and Amortization Net Book Value Upto 31st March, 2022 For the year On Withdrawals and adjustments Upto 31st March, 2023 For the year On Withdrawals and adjustments# Upto 31st March, 2024 As at 31st March, 2024 As at 31st March, 2023 3A.

(vi) Employee Benefit Plans Description of Plans \\x07 The Company makes contributions to both Defined Benefit and Defined Contribution Plans for qualifying employees. These Plans are administered through approved Trusts, which operate in accordance with the Trust Deeds, Rules and applicable Statutes. The concerned Trusts are managed by Trustees who provide strategic guidance with regard to the management of their investments and liabilities and also periodically review their performance. \\x07 Provident Fund, Pension and Gratuity Benefits are funded and Leave Encashment Benefits are unfunded in nature. The Defined Benefit Pension Plans are based on employees’ pensionable remuneration and length of service. Under the Provident Fund, Gratuity and Leave Encashment Schemes, employees are entitled to receive lump sum benefits. (a) Defined Benefit Plans: \\x07 The liabilities arising in the Defined Benefit Schemes are determined in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries, using the projected unit credit method. The Company makes regular contributions to these Defined Benefit Plans. Additional contributions are made to these plans as and when required based on actuarial valuation. Some Group companies also participate in these Plans. These participating Group companies make contributions to the Plans for their respective employees on a uniform basis and each entity ascertains their obligation through actuarial valuation. The net Defined benefit cost is recognised by these companies in their respective Financial Statements. Risk Management \\x07 The Defined Benefit Plans expose the Company to risk of actuarial deficit arising out of investment risk, interest rate risk and salary cost inflation risk. \\x07 Investment Risk: This may arise from volatility in asset values due to market fluctuations and impairment of assets due to credit losses. These Plans primarily invest in debt instruments such as Government securities and highly rated corporate bonds – the valuation of which is inversely proportional to the interest rate movements. \\x07 Interest Rate Risk: The present value of Defined Benefit Plan liability is determined using the discount rate based on the market yields prevailing at the end of reporting period on Government securities. A decrease in yields will increase the fund liabilities and vice-versa. \\x07 Salary Cost Inflation Risk: The present value of the Defined Benefit Plan liability is calculated with reference to the future salaries of participants under the Plan. Increase in salary might lead to higher liabilities. \\x07 These Plans have a relatively balanced mix of investments in order to manage the above risks. The investment strategy is designed based on the interest rate scenario, liquidity needs of the Plans and pattern of investment as prescribed under various statutes. \\x07 The Trustees regularly monitor the funding and investments of these Plans. Risk mitigation systems are in place to ensure that the health of the portfolio is regularly reviewed and investments do not pose any significant risk of impairment. Periodic audits are conducted to ensure adequacy of internal controls. Pension obligation of the employees is secured by purchasing annuities thereby de-risking the Plans from future payment obligation.\\n28.\\tAdditional Notes to the Financial Statements (Contd.)

Consequently, the Company has disclosed material accounting policies. There is no impact on the standalone financial statements. \\x07 Ind AS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ - This amendment has narrowed the scope of the initial recognition exemption so that it does not apply to transactions that give rise to equal and offsetting temporary differences. The amendments clarify how companies account for deferred tax on transactions such as leases. \\x07 The Company previously recognised for deferred tax on leases on a net basis. Pursuant to the aforementioned amendment, the Company has grossed-up the deferred tax assets (DTA) and deferred tax liabilities (DTL) recognised in relation to leases by ` 70.05 Crores each w.e.f. 1st April, 2022.

Financial risk management objectives \\x07 The Company has a system-based approach to risk management, anchored to policies and procedures and internal financial controls aimed at ensuring early identification, evaluation and management of key financial risks (such as market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk) that may arise as a consequence of its business operations as well as its investing and financing activities. Accordingly, the Company’s risk management framework has the objective of ensuring that such risks are managed within acceptable and approved risk parameters in a disciplined and consistent manner and in compliance with the applicable regulations. It also seeks to drive accountability in this regard. Liquidity Risk \\x07 The Company’s Current assets aggregate ` 36070.67 Crores (2023 - ` 35203.44 Crores) including Current Investments, Cash and cash equivalents and Other Bank Balances of ` 18134.57 Crores (2023 - ` 20188.33 Crores) against an aggregate Current liability of ` 12415.61 Crores (2023 - ` 12415.62 Crores). As part of its surplus liquidity management operations, the Company may sell instruments that are held at amortised cost. Such sales may be infrequent (even if significant in value) or insignificant in value both individually and in aggregate (even if frequent). During the year, the net loss arising on such sale amounted to ` 16.37 Crores (2023 - ` 49.13 Crores) (Refer Note 22). \\x07 Other Non-current liabilities (other than lease liabilities) due between one year to three years amounted to ` 110.07 Crores (2023 - ` 154.16 Crores) and Other Non-current liabilities due after three years amounted to ` 1.56 Crores (2023 - ` 1.61 Crores) on the reporting date. The maturity analysis of undiscounted lease liabilities are disclosed under Note 28(vii). \\x07 Further, while the Company’s total equity stands at ` 70984.83 Crores (2023 - ` 67593.80 Crores), it has non-current borrowings of ` 1.76 Crores (2023 - ` 3.28 Crores). In such circumstances, liquidity risk or the risk that the Company may not be able to settle or meet its obligations as they become due does not exist. Market Risk A. Foreign Currency Risk \\x07 The Company undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currency (mainly US Dollar, Pound Sterling, Euro and Japanese Yen) which are subject to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. Financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency, including the Company’s net investments in foreign operations (with a functional currency other than Indian Rupee), are also subject to reinstatement risks.\\n226 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 ITC Limited Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 31.

The proportion of forecast transactions that are to be hedged is decided based on the size of the forecast transaction and market conditions. As the counterparty for such transactions are highly rated banks or recognised exchange(s), the risk of their non-performance is considered to be insignificant. \\x07 The Company uses derivatives to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Where such derivatives are not designated under hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of such hedges are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. (In Million) (In Million) REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 227 ITC Limited Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 31. Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures (Contd.) \\x07 The Company may also designate certain hedges as cash flow hedges to mitigate the risk of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable forecasted cash transactions. The currency, amount and tenure of such hedges are generally matched to the underlying transaction(s). Changes in the fair value of the effective portion of cash flow hedges are recognised as cash flow hedging reserve in Other Comprehensive Income. While the probability of such hedges becoming ineffective is very low, the ineffective portion, if any, is immediately recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The movement in the cash flow hedging reserve in respect of designated cash flow hedges is summarised below: (` in Crores) Particulars 2024 2023 At the beginning of the year 2.48 14.33 Add: Changes in the fair value of effective portion of matured cash flow hedges during the year (6.43) (154.16) Add: Changes in fair value of effective portion of outstanding cash flow hedges (3.45) 17.81 Less: Amounts transferred to the Statement of Profit and Loss on occurrence of forecast hedge transactions during the year (17.73) (81.93) Less: Amounts transferred to the Statement of Profit and Loss due to cash flows no longer expected to occur (1.40) (28.19) Less: Amounts transferred to initial cost of non-financial assets 10.85 (10.40) Less: Net gain / (loss) transferred to the Statement of Profit and Loss on Ineffectiveness – – (Less) / Add: Deferred tax 0.41 3.98 At the end of the year 1.29 2.48 Of the above, balances remaining in cash flow hedge reserve for matured hedging relationships 2.19 (11.20) \\x07 Once the hedged transaction materialises, the amount accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve will be included in the initial cost of the non-financial hedged item on its initial recognition or reclassified to profit or loss, as applicable, in the anticipated timeframes given below: \\x08 (` in Crores) Outstanding balance in Cash Flow Hedge Reserve to be subsequently recycled from OCI As at 31st March, 2024 As at 31st March, 2023 Within one year 1.31 2.47 Between one and three years (0.02) 0.01 Total 1.29 2.48 Foreign Currency Sensitivity \\x07 For every percentage point increase / decrease in the underlying exchange rate of the outstanding foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, including derivative contracts, holding all other variables constant, the profit before tax for the year ended 31st March, 2024 would decrease / increase by ` 1.71 Crores (2023 - ` 2.85 Crores) and other equity as at 31st March, 2024 would decrease / increase by ` 4.91 Crores (2023 - ` 2.68 Crores) on a pre-tax basis. B. Interest Rate Risk \\x07 As the Company is virtually debt-free and its deferred payment liabilities do not carry interest, the exposure to interest rate risk from the perspective of financial liabilities is negligible. Further, treasury activities, focused on managing investments in debt instruments, are centralised and administered under a set of approved policies and procedures guided by the tenets of safety, liquidity and returns. This ensures that investments are made within acceptable risk parameters after due evaluation. \\x07 The Company’s investments are predominantly held in bonds / debentures, fixed deposits, certificates of deposit and debt mutual funds. Mark to market movements in respect of the Company’s investments in bonds / debentures that are held at amortised cost 228 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 ITC Limited Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 31. Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures (Contd.) are temporary and get recouped through coupon accruals. Other investments in bonds / debentures, certificates of deposit are fair valued through the Statement of Profit and Loss to recognise market volatility, which is not considered to be significant. Fixed deposits are held with highly rated banks and companies and have a short tenure and are not subject to interest rate volatility. \\x07 The Company also invests in debt mutual fund schemes of leading fund houses. Such investments are susceptible to market price risks that arise mainly from changes in interest rate which may impact the return and value of such investments. However, given the relatively short tenure of underlying portfolio of the debt mutual fund schemes in which the Company has invested, such price risk is not significant. C. Other Price Risk \\x07 The Company is not an active investor in equity markets; it holds certain investments in equity for long term value accretion which are accordingly measured at fair value through Other Comprehensive Income. The value of investments in such equity instruments as at 31st March, 2024 is ` 3979.47 Crores (2023 - ` 1464.41 Crores). Accordingly, fair value fluctuations arising from market volatility is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income. \\x07 For select agricultural commodities primarily held for trading, futures contracts are used to hedge price risks till positions in the physical market are matched. Such activities are managed by the business team within an approved policy framework. The carrying value of inventories is adjusted to the extent of fair value movement of the risk being hedged. Such hedges are generally for short time horizons and recognised in profit or loss within the crop cycle. Accordingly, the Company’s net exposure to commodity price risk is considered to be insignificant. Credit Risk \\x07 Company’s deployment in debt instruments are primarily in Government securities, fixed deposits with highly rated banks and companies, bonds issued by Government institutions, public sector undertakings, mutual fund schemes of leading fund houses and certificates of deposit issued by highly rated banks and financial institutions. Of this, investments that are held at amortised cost stood at ` 13802.74 Crores (2023 - ` 15420.01 Crores). With respect to the Company’s investing activities, debt mutual fund schemes and counter parties are shortlisted and exposure limits determined on the basis of their credit rating (by independent agencies), financial statements and other relevant information. As these counter parties are Central / State Government, Government institutions / public sector undertakings with investment grade / sovereign credit ratings and taking into account the experience of the Company over time, the counter party risk attached to such assets is considered to be insignificant. \\x07 The Company’s customer base is large and diverse limiting the risk arising out of credit concentration. Company’s payment terms generally ranges from advance (generally settled within the operating cycle) to a credit period of up to 180 days, depending upon specific circumstances and industry practices. Credit is extended in business interest in accordance with guidelines issued centrally and business-specific credit policies that are consistent with such guidelines. Exceptions are managed and approved by appropriate authorities, after due consideration of the counterparty’s credentials and financial capacity, trade practices and prevailing business and economic conditions. There is no significant financing component and / or remaining performance obligation in respect of its transaction with the customers for sale of goods and services. The Company’s exposure to trade receivables on the reporting date, net of expected loss provisions, stood at ` 3311.45 Crores (2023 - ` 2321.33 Crores). \\x07 The Company’s historical experience of collecting receivables and the level of default indicate that credit risk is low and generally uniform across markets; consequently, trade receivables are considered to be a single class of financial assets. All overdue customer balances are evaluated taking into account the age of the dues, specific credit circumstances, the track record of the counterparty etc. Loss allowances and impairment is recognised, where considered appropriate by responsible management. \\x07 The movement of the expected loss provision (allowance for bad and doubtful loans, advances and receivables etc.) made by the Company are as under: \\x08 (` in Crores) Particulars Expected Loss Provision 31st March, 2024 31st March, 2023 Opening Balance 210.44 214.05 Add: Provisions made (net) 9.68 (0.25) Less: Utilisation for impairment / de-recognition 16.36 3.36 Closing Balance 203.76 210.44 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 229 ITC Limited Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements 31.

If significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2. \\x07 Derivatives are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs such as foreign exchange spot rates and forward rates at the end of the reporting period, yield curves, risk free rate of returns, volatility etc., as applicable. The fair value of investment in Bonds / Debentures, Certificates of Deposit, Venture Capital funds etc. and financial liabilities, where applicable, is determined using market observable inputs such as quotes from market participants, value published by the issuer etc. Level 3: Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). \\x07 If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the fair value is determined using generally accepted methodologies such as discounted cash flow analysis, with the most significant inputs being the discount rate that reflects the credit risk of counterparty. \\x07 The fair value of trade receivables, trade payables and other current financial assets and liabilities is considered to be equal to the carrying amounts of these items due to their short – term nature. Where such items are non-current in nature, the same has been classified as Level 3 and fair value determined using discounted cash flow basis. Similarly, unquoted equity instruments where most recent information to measure fair value is insufficient, or if there is a wide range of possible fair value measurements, cost has been considered as best estimate of fair value. \\x07 There has been no change in the valuation methodology for Level 3 inputs during the year. The Company has not classified any material financial instruments under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The sensitivity of change in the unobservable inputs used in fair valuation of Level 3 financial assets and liabilities does not have a significant impact on their value. There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the year.\\nREPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 231 ITC Limited In terms of our report attached For S R B C & CO LLP Chartered Accountants Firm Registration Number: 324982E / E300003 Arvind Sethi Partner (Membership No.: 89802) Kolkata, May 23, 2024 On behalf of the Board S.

The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the standalone Ind AS financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the standalone Ind AS financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the standalone Ind AS financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether such other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\\nResponsibilities of Management for the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone Ind AS financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance including other comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone Ind AS financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\\nIn preparing the standalone Ind AS financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\\nThose Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.\\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone Ind AS financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone Ind AS financial statements.\\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: • \\x07 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone Ind AS financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. • \\x07 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.\\n• \\x07 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. • \\x07 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone Ind AS financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the standalone Ind AS financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the standalone Ind AS financial statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2024 and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\\nReport on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements 1. \\x07 As required by the Companies (Auditor’s Report) Order, 2020 (“the Order”), issued by the Central Government of India in terms of sub-section (11) of section 143 of the Act, we give in the “Annexure 1” a statement on the matters specified in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Order.\\n2. \\x07 As required by Section 143(3) of the Act, we report, to the extent applicable, that: (a)\\t\\x07 We have sought and obtained all the information and explanations which to the best of our knowledge and belief were necessary for the purposes of our audit;

Material Accounting Policies Statement of Compliance These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 and amendments thereto. The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with the relevant presentation requirements of the Companies Act, 2013. The Group adopted Ind AS from 1st April, 2016. Basis of Preparation The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention, except for certain items that are measured at amortised cost or fair value, as explained in the accounting policies.\\nFair Value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and / or disclosure purposes in these consolidated financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for share-based payment transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 102 – Share-based Payment, leasing transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 116 – Leases and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net realisable value in Ind AS 2 – Inventories or value in use in Ind AS 36 – Impairment of Assets.\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period; they are recognised in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\\nBasis of Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements (CFS) include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries together with the share of the total comprehensive income of joint ventures and associates.\\nSubsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Associates are entities over which the Group exercise significant influence but does not control. Joint Ventures (“JV”) are entities in which the Group has the ability to exercise control jointly with one or more uncontrolled entities and the parties have proportionate interests in the assets and liabilities of the JV entity. Control, significant influence and joint control is assessed annually with reference to the voting power (usually arising from equity shareholdings and potential voting rights) and other rights (usually contractual) enjoyed by the Group in its capacity as an investor that provides it the power and consequential ability to direct the investee’s activities and significantly affect the Group’s returns from its investment. Such assessment requires the exercise of judgement and is disclosed by way of a note to the Financial Statements. The Group is considered not to be in control of entities where it is unclear as to whether it enjoys such power over the investee. The assets, liabilities, income and expenses of subsidiaries are aggregated and consolidated, line by line, from the date control is acquired by any Group entity to the date it ceases. Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the Group as owners and to the non-controlling interests. The Group presents the non-controlling interests in the Balance Sheet within equity, separately from the equity of the Group as owners. The excess of the Group’s investment in a subsidiary over its share in the net worth of such subsidiary on the date control is acquired is treated as goodwill while a deficit is considered as a capital reserve in the CFS. Group Information ITC Limited (the ‘Holding Company’) [CIN: L16005WB1910PLC001985] is a public limited company domiciled in India with its registered office located at Virginia House, 37 Jawaharlal Nehru Road, Kolkata 700071. The Holding Company’s shares are listed on the National Stock Exchange of India Limited, BSE Limited and The Calcutta Stock Exchange Limited. The Holding Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’) has presence in multiple businesses spanning Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (Cigarettes & Cigars, Foods, Personal Care Products, Education & Stationery Products, Safety Matches and Agarbattis), Hotels, Paperboards, Paper and Packaging, Agri Business and Information Technology.\\nREPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 259 ITC Limited 1. Material Accounting Policies (Contd.) An investment in an associate or a JV is initially recognised at cost on the date of the investment, and inclusive of any goodwill / capital reserve embedded in the cost, in the Balance Sheet. The proportionate share of the Group in the net profits / losses as also in the other comprehensive income is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss and the carrying value of the investment is adjusted by a like amount (referred as ‘equity method’). All intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation. While preparing CFS, appropriate adjustments are made to subsidiaries / associates / JVs financial statements to ensure conformity with the Group’s accounting policies.\\nOperating Cycle All assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-current as per the Group’s normal operating cycle and other criteria set out in the Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013 and Ind AS 1 – Presentation of Financial Statements based on the nature of products and the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents. The Group has identified twelve months as its operating cycle.\\nProperty, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment (PP&E) are stated at cost of acquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment, if any. For this purpose, cost includes deemed cost which represents the carrying value of PP&E recognised as at 1st April, 2015 measured as per the previous Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).\\nCost is inclusive of inward freight, duties and taxes and incidental expenses related to acquisition. In respect of major projects involving construction, related pre-operational expenses form part of the value of assets capitalised. Expenses capitalised also include applicable borrowing costs for qualifying assets, if any. All upgradation / enhancements are charged off as revenue expenditure unless they bring similar significant additional benefits. An item of PP&E is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of PP&E is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\\nDepreciation of these assets commences when the assets are ready for their intended use, which is generally on commissioning. Items of PP&E are depreciated in a manner that amortizes the cost (or other amount substituted for cost) of the assets after commissioning, less its residual value, over their useful lives as specified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013 on a straight line basis. Land is not depreciated.\\nThe estimated useful lives of PP&E of the Group are as follows: Buildings 30-60 Years Leasehold Improvement Shorter of lease period or estimated useful lives Plant and Equipment 3-25 Years Furniture and Fixtures 8-10 Years Vehicles 8-10 Years Office Equipment 5 Years PP&E’s residual values, useful lives and method of depreciation are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and changes, if any, are treated as changes in accounting estimate. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill arising on Business Combination is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. The Group also presents the excess of the Group’s investment in a subsidiary over its share in the net worth of such subsidiary on the date control is acquired as goodwill arising on consolidation. Goodwill is annually tested for impairment. Impairment loss, if any, to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount is charged off to the Statement of Profit and Loss as it arises and is not reversed. For impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to Cash Generating Unit (CGU) or group of CGUs to which it relates, which is not larger than an operating segment, and is monitored for internal management purposes.\\nOn disposal of the CGU or group of CGUs, attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\\nOther Intangible Assets Other Intangible Assets that the Group controls and from which it expects future economic benefits, are capitalised upon acquisition and measured initially: a. for assets acquired in a business combination, at fair value on the date of acquisition. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 260 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 ITC Limited b. for separately acquired assets, at cost comprising the purchase price (including import duties and non-refundable taxes) and directly attributable costs to prepare the asset for its intended use.\\nInternally generated assets for which the cost is clearly identifiable are capitalised at cost. Research expenditure is recognised as an expense when it is incurred. Development costs are capitalised only after the technical and commercial feasibility of the asset for sale or use has been established. Thereafter, all directly attributable expenditure incurred to prepare the asset for its intended use are recognised as the cost of such assets. Internally generated brands, websites and customer lists are not recognised as intangible assets. The carrying value of intangible assets includes deemed cost which represents the carrying value of intangible assets recognised as at 1st April, 2015 measured as per the previous GAAP.\\nAfter initial recognition, an intangible asset is carried at its cost less accumulated amortization and\\u2009/ or impairment losses.\\nThe useful life of an intangible asset is considered finite where the rights to such assets are limited to a specified period of time by contract or law (e.g. patents, licences, trademarks, franchise and servicing rights) or the likelihood of technical, technological obsolescence (e.g. computer software, design, prototypes) or commercial obsolescence (e.g. lesser known brands are those to which adequate marketing support may not be provided). If, there are no such limitations, the useful life is taken to be indefinite. Intangible assets that have finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives by the straight-line method unless it is practical to reliably determine the pattern of benefits arising from the asset. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is not amortized. However, it is annually tested for impairment. Amortization expenses and impairment losses and reversal of impairment losses are included in the ‘Depreciation and amortization expense’ in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The estimated useful lives of intangible assets of the Group with finite lives are as follows: Trademarks\\u2009/\\u2009Know How, Business and Commercial Rights 10 Years (unless shorter useful life is required based on contractual or legal terms) Computer Software 5 Years Customer Relationships 8 Years The useful lives of intangible assets are reviewed annually to determine if a reset of such useful life is required for assets with finite lives and to confirm that business circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life assessment for assets so classified. Based on such review, the useful life may change or the useful life assessment may change from indefinite to finite. The impact of such changes is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate. Investment Property Properties that are held for long-term rental yields and / or for capital appreciation are classified as investment properties. Investment properties are stated at cost of acquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Depreciation is recognised using the straight line method so as to amortize the cost of investment properties over their useful lives as specified in Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013. Freehold land and properties under construction are not depreciated. Transfers to, or from, investment properties are made at the carrying amount when and only when there is a change in use. An item of investment property is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of asset. Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of investment property is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the property and is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\\nIncome received from investment property is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\\nImpairment of Assets Impairment loss, if any, is provided to the extent, the carrying amount of assets or cash generating units exceeds their recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset or cash generating unit and from its disposal at the end of its useful life. Impairment losses recognised in prior years are reversed when there is an indication that the impairment losses recognised no longer exist or have decreased. Such reversals are recognised as an increase in carrying amounts of assets to the extent that it does not exceed the carrying amounts that would have been determined (net of amortization or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised in previous years. 1. Material Accounting Policies (Contd.) Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 261 ITC Limited Inventories Inventories are stated at lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost is calculated on weighted average method. Cost comprises expenditure incurred in the normal course of business in bringing such inventories to their present location and condition and includes, where applicable, appropriate overheads based on normal level of activity. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs for completion and sale.\\nObsolete, slow moving and defective inventories are identified from time to time and, where necessary, a provision is made for such inventories. Foreign Currency Transactions The presentation currency of the Group is Indian Rupee. Transactions in foreign currency are accounted for at the exchange rate prevailing on the transaction date. Gains\\u2009/\\u2009losses arising on settlement as also on translation of monetary items are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\\nExchange differences arising on monetary items that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in a foreign operation (having a functional currency other than Indian Rupee) are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in foreign currency translation reserve. For the preparation of the consolidated financial statements: (a)\\tassets and liabilities of foreign operations, together with goodwill and fair value adjustments assumed on acquisition thereof, are translated to Indian Rupees at exchange rates prevailing at the reporting period end; (b)\\tincome and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period; when exchange rates fluctuate significantly the rates prevailing on the transaction date are used instead. Differences arising on such translation are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in foreign currency translation reserve and attributed to non-controlling interests proportionately.\\nOn the disposal of a foreign operation, all of the exchange differences accumulated in equity in respect of that operation attributable to the owners of the Group is reclassified to the Statement of Profit and Loss. In relation to a partial disposal, that does not result in losing control over the subsidiary, the proportionate exchange differences accumulated in equity is reclassified to the Statement of Profit and Loss.\\nDerivatives and Hedge Accounting Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gains\\u2009/\\u2009losses are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which case the resulting gain /\\u2009loss is recognised as per the hedge accounting principles stated below.\\nThe Group complies with the principles of hedge accounting where derivative contracts and / or non-derivative financial assets\\u2009/\\u2009liabilities that are permitted under applicable accounting standards are designated as hedging instruments. At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with the risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking hedge transaction, which can be a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge.\\n(i) Fair value hedges Changes in fair value of the designated portion of hedging instruments that qualify as fair value hedges are recognised in profit or loss immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. Such fair value changes are recognised in the line item relating to the hedged item in Statement of Profit and Loss. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument is derecognised, expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortised to profit or loss from that date. (ii)\\tCash flow hedges The effective portion of changes in the fair value of hedging instrument that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in the other comprehensive income and accumulated as ‘Cash Flow Hedge Reserve’. The gains / losses relating to the ineffective portion are recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Amounts previously recognised and accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged item affects the Statement of Profit and Loss. However, when the hedged item results in the recognition of a non-financial asset, such gains\\u2009/\\u2009losses are transferred from equity (but not as reclassification adjustment) and included in the initial measurement cost of the non-financial asset. 1. Material Accounting Policies (Contd.) Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 262 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 ITC Limited Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument is derecognised, expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gains\\u2009/\\u2009losses recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity at that time remain in equity and is reclassified when the underlying transaction is ultimately recognised. When an underlying transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gains\\u2009/\\u2009losses accumulated in equity are recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\\nInvestment in Associates and Joint Ventures Investment in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the ‘equity method’ less accumulated impairment, if any. Financial instruments, Financial assets, Financial liabilities and Equity instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the relevant instrument and are initially measured at fair value except for trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component, which are measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value on initial recognition of financial assets or financial liabilities. Purchase or sale of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date when the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.\\nFinancial Assets Recognition: Financial assets include Investments, Trade receivables, Advances, Security deposits, Cash and cash equivalents. Such assets are initially recognised at fair value or transaction price, as applicable, when the Group becomes party to contractual obligations. The transaction price includes transaction costs unless the asset is being fair valued through the Statement of Profit and Loss. Classification: Management determines the classification of an asset at initial recognition depending on the purpose for which the assets were acquired. The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on such classification.\\nFinancial assets are classified as those measured at: (a)\\tamortised cost, where the financial assets are held solely for collection of cash flows arising from payments of principal and / or interest. (b)\\tfair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI), where the financial assets are held not only for collection of cash flows arising from payments of principal and interest but also from the sale of such assets. Such assets are subsequently measured at fair value, with unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value being recognised in other comprehensive income. (c)\\tfair value through profit or loss (FVTPL), where the assets are managed in accordance with an approved investment strategy that triggers purchase and sale decisions based on the fair value of such assets. Such assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value, including interest income and dividend income, if any, are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they arise.\\nTrade receivables, Advances, Security deposits, Cash and cash equivalents etc. are classified for measurement at amortised cost while investments may fall under any of the aforesaid classes. However, in respect of particular investments in equity instruments that would otherwise be measured at fair value through profit or loss, an irrevocable election at initial recognition may be made to present subsequent changes in fair value through other comprehensive income.\\nImpairment: The Group assesses at each reporting date whether a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) such as Investments, Trade receivables, Advances and Security deposits held at amortised cost and financial assets that are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are tested for impairment based on evidence or information that is available without undue cost or effort. Expected credit losses are assessed and loss allowances recognised if the credit quality of the financial asset has deteriorated significantly since initial recognition. Reclassification: When and only when the business model is changed, the Group shall reclassify all affected financial assets prospectively from the reclassification date as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss without restating the previously recognised gains, losses or interest and in terms of the reclassification principles laid down in the Ind AS relating to Financial Instruments.\\n1. Material Accounting Policies (Contd.) Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 263 ITC Limited Derecognition: Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash flows from the assets has expired, or has been transferred, and the Group has transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. Concomitantly, if the asset is one that is measured at: (a)\\tamortised cost, the gain or loss is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss; (b)\\tfair value through other comprehensive income, the cumulative fair value adjustments previously taken to reserves are reclassified to the Statement of Profit and Loss unless the asset represents an equity investment, in which case the cumulative fair value adjustments previously taken to reserves are reclassified within equity. Income Recognition: Interest income is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the right to receive dividend is established.\\nFinancial Liabilities Borrowings, trade payables and other financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Any discount or premium on redemption\\u2009/\\u2009settlement is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss as finance cost over the life of the liability using the effective interest method and adjusted to the liability figure disclosed in the Balance Sheet. Financial liabilities are derecognised when the liability is extinguished, that is, when the contractual obligation is discharged, cancelled or on expiry. Offsetting Financial Instruments Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is included in the Balance Sheet where there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\\nEquity Instruments Equity instruments are recognised at the value of the proceeds, net of direct costs of the capital issue.\\nRevenue Revenue is measured at the transaction price that the Company receives or expects to receive as consideration for goods supplied and services rendered, net of returns and estimates of variable consideration such as discounts to customers. Revenue from the sale of goods includes Excise Duties and National Calamity Contingent Duty which are payable on manufacture of goods but excludes taxes such as VAT and Goods and Services Tax which are payable in respect of sale of goods and services.\\nRevenue from the sale of goods and services is recognised when the Group performs its obligations to its customers and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably and recovery of the consideration is probable. The timing of such recognition in case of sale of goods is when the control over the same is transferred to the customer, which is mainly upon delivery and in case of services, in the period in which such services are rendered.\\nGovernment Grant Group entities may receive government grants that require compliance with certain conditions related to the entity’s operating activities or are provided to the entity by way of financial assistance on the basis of certain qualifying criteria. Government grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received upon the Group entity complying with the conditions attached to the grant. Accordingly, government grants: (a)\\trelated to or used for assets, are deducted from the carrying amount of the asset. (b)\\trelated to incurring specific expenditures are taken to the Statement of Profit and Loss on the same basis and in the same periods as the expenditures incurred. (c)\\tby way of financial assistance on the basis of certain qualifying criteria are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss as they become receivable. In the unlikely event that a grant previously recognised is ultimately not received, it is treated as a change in estimate and the amount cumulatively recognised is expensed in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Dividend Distribution Dividends paid (including income tax thereon, if any) are recognised in the period in which the interim dividends are approved by the Board of Directors, or in respect of the final dividend when approved by shareholders.\\nEmployee Benefits Short-term employee benefits are expensed in the period in which the employee renders the related service on an undiscounted basis. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid within twelve months, if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay the same as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be reliably estimated.\\nThe Group makes contributions to both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes which are mainly administered through duly constituted and approved Trusts. Provident Fund contributions are in the nature of defined contribution scheme. In respect of employees who are 1. Material Accounting Policies (Contd.) Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 264 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 ITC Limited members of constituted and approved trusts, the Group recognises contribution payable to such trusts as an expense including any shortfall in interest between the amount of interest realised by the investment and the interest payable to members at the rate declared by the Government of India. In respect of other employees, provident funds are deposited with the Government and recognised as expense. The Group makes contribution to defined contribution pension plan. The contribution payable is recognised as an expense, when an employee renders the related service. The Group also makes contribution to defined benefit pension and gratuity plan. The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuary using the projected unit credit method. Service costs and net interest expense or income is reflected in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Gain or Loss on account of remeasurements are recognised immediately through other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. The employees of the Group are entitled to compensated leave for which the Group records the liability based on actuarial valuation computed using projected unit credit method. These benefits are unfunded.\\nActual disbursements made under the Workers’ Voluntary Retirement Scheme are accounted as revenue expenses.\\nEmployee Share Based Compensation Stock Options Stock Options are granted to eligible employees under the ITC Employee Stock Option Schemes (“ITC ESOS”), as may be decided by the Nomination & Compensation Committee\\u2009/\\u2009Board. Eligible employees for this purpose include employees of the Group entities, their Directors and those on deputation to joint ventures and associates. Under Ind AS, the cost of ITC Stock Options (Stock Options) is recognised based on the fair value of Stock Options as on the grant date. The fair values of Stock Options granted is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss over the period in which the performance and / or service conditions are fulfilled for employees of the Group (other than those out on deputation). The value of Stock Options, net of reimbursements, granted to employees on deputation is considered as capital contribution / investment. The Group generally seeks reimbursement of the value of Stock Options from such companies, as applicable. It may, if so recommended by the Corporate Management Committee and approved by the Audit Committee, decide not to seek such reimbursements in respect of value of Stock Options from such companies, who need to conserve financial capacity to sustain their business and growth plans and where the quantum of reimbursement is not material - the materiality threshold being ` 5 Crores for each entity for a financial year.\\nCash Settled Stock Appreciation Linked Reward (SAR) Plan Cash Settled SAR units are granted to eligible employees under the ITC Employee Cash Settled Stock Appreciation Linked Reward Plan (“ITC ESARP”). The eligible employees for this purpose are such present and future permanent employees of the Company, including a Director of the Company, as may be decided by the CMC / Nomination & Compensation Committee / Board. For cash settled SAR units granted to eligible employees, a liability is initially measured at fair value at the grant date and is subsequently remeasured at each reporting period, until settled. The fair value of ESAR units granted is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss over the period in which the performance and / or service conditions are fulfilled for employees of the Group. In case of employees on deputation to group companies, the Company generally seeks reimbursements from the concerned group company. The value of such payments, net of reimbursements, is considered as capital contribution / investment.\\nLeases The Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\\nGroup as a Lessee Right-of-Use (ROU) assets are recognised at inception of a contract or arrangement for significant lease components at cost less lease incentives, if any. ROU assets are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. The cost of ROU assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct cost incurred and lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date. ROU assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and estimated useful lives of the underlying assets on a straight-line basis. Lease term is determined based on consideration of facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not to exercise a termination option. Lease payments associated with short-term leases (i.e., those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option) and low value leases (i.e., where the value of the underlying asset, when new, in 1. Material Accounting Policies (Contd.) Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 265 ITC Limited 1. Material Accounting Policies (Contd.) order of magnitude is ` 5 lakhs or less) are charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. The Group recognises lease liabilities measured at the present value of lease payments to be made on the date of recognition of the lease. Such lease liabilities do not include variable lease payments (that do not depend on an index or a rate), which are recognised as expense in the periods in which they are incurred. Interest on lease liability is recognised using the effective interest method. Lease liabilities are subsequently increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. The carrying amount of lease liabilities is also remeasured upon modification of lease arrangement or upon change in the assessment of the lease term. The effect of such remeasurements is adjusted to the value of the ROU assets.\\nGroup as a Lessor Leases in which the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset are classified as operating leases. Where the Group is a lessor under an operating lease, the asset is capitalised within property, plant and equipment or investment property and depreciated over its useful economic life. Payments received under operating leases are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\\nTaxes on Income Taxes on income comprise current taxes and deferred taxes. Current tax in the Statement of Profit and Loss is provided as the amount of tax payable in respect of taxable income for the period using tax rates and tax laws enacted during the period, together with any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the amounts used for taxation purposes (tax base), at the tax rates and tax laws enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax assets are recognised for the future tax consequences to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences can be utilised.\\nIncome tax, insofar as it relates to items disclosed under other comprehensive income or equity, is disclosed separately under other comprehensive income or equity, as applicable.\\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\\nClaims Claims against the Group not acknowledged as debts are disclosed after a careful evaluation of the facts and legal aspects of the matter involved.\\nProvisions Provisions are recognised when, as a result of a past event, the Group has a legal or constructive obligation; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and the amount can be reliably estimated. The amount so recognised is a best estimate of the consideration required to settle the obligation at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.\\nIn an event when the time value of money is material, the provision is carried at the present value of the cash flows estimated to settle the obligation.\\nOperating Segments Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker (CODM). The CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Corporate Management Committee. Segments are organised based on businesses which have similar economic characteristics as well as exhibit similarities in nature of products and services offered, the nature of production processes, the type and class of customer and distribution methods.\\nSegment revenue arising from third party customers is reported on the same basis as revenue in the financial statements. Inter-segment revenue is reported on the basis of transactions which are primarily market led. Segment results represent profits before finance charges, unallocated corporate expenses and taxes. “Unallocated Corporate Expenses” include revenue and expenses that relate to initiatives / costs attributable to the enterprise as a whole. Financial and Management Information Systems The Group’s Accounting System is designed to unify the Financial and Cost Records and also to comply with the relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, to provide financial and cost information appropriate to the businesses and facilitate Internal Control.\\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 266 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 ITC Limited The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the results of operations during the reporting period end. Although these estimates are based upon management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results could differ from these estimates.\\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\\nA. Judgements in applying accounting policies The following are the judgements, apart from those involving estimations (see note B below), that the Group have made in the process of applying the accounting policies and that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements: 1. Control: The Group assessed whether or not it has control on its investees based on whether, as an investor, it has the power / rights and consequently the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of its investees unilaterally. In making this judgement, the Group considered the absolute size of its holding, the relative size of and dispersion of other shareholders, and whether any contractual arrangements exist between the Company (and its subsidiaries) and other shareholders of the investees. Based on this, and in accordance with its Accounting Policy, the Group has determined that the entities listed in the notes to the financial statements are the only entities over which Group has control. The Company is a settlor for certain trusts, i.e., ITC Sangeet Research Academy, ITC Education and Health Care Trust and ITC Rural Development Trust. The Group while considering the nature and insignificant variability of its return has concluded that it does not ‘control’ these trusts.\\n2. Significant influence: The Group assessed whether or not it has significant influence on its investees based on its practical ability to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, though it is not in control or in joint control of these policies. Based on such assessment, the Group determined that the entities listed in the notes to the financial statements are the only entities over which the Group has significant influence, and accordingly recognised as associates. 3. Joint Control: (i) The Group holds 50% of the equity share capital of Maharaja Heritage Resorts Limited, a company involved in operation of hotel properties. The Group do not consider that it is able to exercise control over the company as the decisions about relevant activities of the company are made jointly between the Group and the co-venturer (who holds 50% of the equity share capital) and both the parties have rights to the net assets of such arrangement. (ii)\\tThe Group holds 27.90% of the equity share capital of Logix Developers Private Limited, a company intended for the purpose of developing a luxury hotel-cum-service apartment complex. The Group has concluded that the key decisions about relevant activities of such company are made jointly between the Group and the co-venturer (who holds 72.10% of the equity share capital) and both the parties have rights to the net assets of such arrangement.\\n(iii)\\tThe Group holds 50% of the equity share capital of ITC Filtrona Limited (formerly known as ITC Essentra Limited), a company involved in manufacture and sale of filter rods. The Group has concluded that the key decisions about relevant activities of such company are made jointly between the Group and the co-venturer (who holds 50% of the equity share capital) and both the parties have rights to the net assets of such arrangement.\\n4. Useful life of Intangible Assets: The Group is required to determine whether its intangible assets have indefinite or finite life which is a subject matter of judgement. Certain trademarks have been considered of having an indefinite useful life taking into account that there are no technical, technological or commercial risks of obsolescence or limitations under contract or law. Other trademarks have been amortised over their useful economic life. Refer notes to the financial statements.\\n2. Use of estimates and judgements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 267 ITC Limited 2. Use of estimates and judgements (Contd.) B. Key sources of estimation uncertainty The following are the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.\\n1. Useful lives of property, plant and equipment, investment property and intangible assets: As described in the material accounting policies, the Group reviews the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment, investment property and intangible assets at the end of each reporting period and the impact of changes in the estimated useful life is considered in the period in which the estimate is revised.\\n2. Fair value measurements and valuation processes: Some of the Group’s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value for financial reporting purposes. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses market-observable data to the extent it is available. Where Level 1 inputs are not available, the Group engages third party valuers, where required, to perform the valuation. Information about the valuation techniques and inputs used in determining the fair value of various assets, liabilities and share based payments are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.\\n3. Actuarial Valuation: The determination of Group’s liability towards defined benefit obligation to employees is made through independent actuarial valuation including determination of amounts to be recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss and in other comprehensive income. Such valuation depends upon assumptions determined after taking into account inflation, seniority, promotion and other relevant factors such as supply and demand factors in the employment market. Information about such valuation is provided in notes to the financial statements. 4. Claims, Provisions and Contingent Liabilities: The Group has ongoing litigations with various regulatory authorities and third parties. Where an outflow of funds is believed to be probable and a reliable estimate of the outcome of the dispute can be made based on management’s assessment of specific circumstances of each dispute and relevant external advice, management provides for its best estimate of the liability. Such accruals are by nature complex and can take number of years to resolve and can involve estimation uncertainty.

The fair value of the investment property is ` 1020.05 Crores (2023 - ` 903.04 Crores). The fair value has been determined on the basis of valuation carried out at the reporting date by registered valuer as defined under rule 2 of Companies (Registered Valuers and Valuation) Rules, 2017 and the same has been categorised as Level 2 based on the valuation techniques used and inputs applied. The main inputs considered by the valuer are government rates, property location, market research & trends, contracted rentals, terminal yields, discount rates and comparable values, as appropriate. Amounts recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in respect of the investment property is as under: 4. Assets with indefinite life pertain to the ‘FMCG - Others’ Segment and are related to the Branded Packaged Foods and Personal Care Products businesses of the Company.\\nImpairment testing for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives has been carried out considering their recoverable amounts which, inter-alia, includes estimation of their value-in-use based on management projections. These projections have been made for a period of five years, or longer, as applicable and consider various factors, such as market scenario, growth trends, growth and margin projections, and terminal growth rates specific to the business. For such projections, discount rate of 10% (2023 - 10%) and long-term growth rates ranging between 5% to 6% (2023 - 5% to 6%) have been considered. Discount rate has been determined considering the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) of market benchmarks.\\nBased on the above assessment, no impairment has been recognised during the year. Further, the Company has also performed sensitivity analysis around the base assumptions and has concluded that there are no reasonably possible changes to key assumptions that would cause the carrying amount of the aforesaid assets to exceed their recoverable values.\\n$As per the contractual arrangements, the Company is responsible for the maintenance of common area at its own cost.

In all these proceedings, the authorities applied an input-output ratio allegedly submitted by SNPL in the year 1990-91 and arrived at a theoretical production and demanded tax / duty on the differential production / turnover. This, despite the fact that SNPL’s cigarette factory was under ‘physical control’ of the Excise authorities and cigarettes produced were duly accounted for and certified as such by the Excise authorities. \\x07 The Revenue Authorities for the first time raised excise demands for the financial years 1993-94 and 1994-95, claiming that SNPL could have produced more cigarettes according to the input-output ratio submitted in the year 1990-91. SNPL challenged these excise demands before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Nepal through a writ petition. A division bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Nepal decided the matter in favour of SNPL (the “Division Bench Judgement”) and rejected the above basis of theoretical production. The Ministry of Finance of Nepal filed a review petition before the Full Bench of Hon’ble Supreme Court of Nepal seeking review of the judgement of Division Bench. The Full Bench after hearing both the sides at length upheld the judgement of Division Bench by its order dated October 29, 2009. \\x07 Similar demands had been raised for other financial years viz., Excise Demands for FY 1998-99 to FY 2002-03 and Income Tax Demand for FY 2001-02, which were also challenged by SNPL before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Nepal by way of writ petitions and the Court was pleased to allow all the writ petitions setting aside the demands. \\x07 Further, the Inland Revenue Department had decided administrative review petitions in favour of SNPL setting aside Value Added Tax demands for the financial years 2001-02 and 2007-08 and Income Tax demand for the FY 2005-06 following the aforesaid decisions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Nepal. \\x07 During the pendency of the aforementioned review petition before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Nepal and thereafter, the Revenue Authorities raised demands and issued a SCN, in the same subject matter of theoretical production for different years (as listed below), which were also challenged by SNPL by way of writ petitions before Hon’ble Supreme Court of Nepal between the years 2007 to 2010: 1. \\x07 Excise demand letters for ` 17.38 Crores [Nepalese Rupee (NRs.) 27.80 Crores] relating to the financial years 2003-04 to 2006-07. 2. \\x07 Value Added Tax (VAT) demand letters for ` 10.93 Crores (NRs. 17.49 Crores) relating to financial years 2002-03 to 2006-07. 3. Income Tax demand letters for ` 13.45 Crores (NRs. 21.52 Crores) relating to financial years 2002-03 and 2003-04. \\x07 SNPL’s writ petitions with regard to various tax demands and a SCN mentioned hereinabove were disposed of by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Nepal on 15th April, 2021 holding that SNPL should avail the alternate remedy by way of appeal to the Inland Revenue Department (IRD). The Administrative Review Petitions relating to above demands are currently pending for disposal with the Inland Revenue Department. 29.\\tAdditional Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Contd.) REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 301 ITC Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements \\x07 The Management considers that all the demands listed above have no legal or factual basis; accordingly, the Management is of the view that there is no liability that is likely to arise, particularly in light of the fact that the issue underlying these demands has already been settled by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Nepal in favour of SNPL. \\x07 It is not practicable for the Group to estimate the closure of these issues and the consequential timings of cash flows, if any, in respect of the above. (b) Uncalled liability on partly paid-up shares and other investments is ` 25.72 Crores (2023 - ` 35.56 Crores). (c) \\x07 Commitments: Estimated amount of contracts remaining to be executed on capital accounts and not provided for are ` 1189.36 Crores (2023 - ` 2113.07 Crores) for the Group, which includes share of joint ventures ` 5.14 Crores (2023 - ` 8.52 Crores). (v) Research and Development expenses for the year amount to ` 170.47 Crores (2023 - ` 161.36 Crores). (vi)\\t\\x07 The Group has adopted Indian Accounting Standard-19 (Ind AS 19) on ‘Employee Benefits’. These Consolidated Financial Statements include the obligations as per requirement of this standard except for those subsidiaries which are incorporated outside India who have determined the valuation / provision for employee benefits as per requirements of their respective countries. In the opinion of the management, the impact of this deviation is not considered material. Description of Plans \\x07 The Group makes contributions to both Defined Benefit and Defined Contribution Plans for qualifying employees. These Plans are administered through approved Trusts, which operate in accordance with the Trust Deeds, Rules and applicable Statutes. The concerned Trusts are managed by Trustees who provide strategic guidance with regard to the management of their investments and liabilities and also periodically review their performance. \\x07 Provident Fund and Pension Benefits are funded, Gratuity Benefits are both funded as well unfunded; and Leave Encashment Benefits are unfunded in nature. The Defined Benefit Pension Plans are based on employees’ pensionable remuneration and length of service. Under the Provident Fund, Gratuity and Leave Encashment Schemes, employees are entitled to receive lump sum benefits. (a) Defined Benefit Plans: \\x07 As per Actuarial Valuations as on 31st March, 2024 and recognised in the financial statements in respect of Employee Benefit Schemes: \\x07 The liabilities arising in the Defined Benefit Schemes are determined in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries, using the projected unit credit method as at year end. The Group makes regular contributions to these Defined Benefit Plans. Additional contributions are made to these plans as and when required based on actuarial valuation. Risk Management \\x07 The Defined Benefit Plans expose the Group to risk of actuarial deficit arising out of investment risk, interest rate risk and salary cost inflation risk. \\x07 Investment Risk: This may arise from volatility in asset values due to market fluctuations and impairment of assets due to credit losses. These Plans primarily invest in debt instruments such as Government securities and highly rated corporate bonds – the valuation of which is inversely proportional to the interest rate movements. \\x07 Interest Rate Risk: The present value of Defined Benefit Plans liability is determined using the discount rate based on the market yields prevailing at the end of reporting period on Government securities. A decrease in yields will increase the fund liabilities and vice-versa. \\x07 Salary Cost Inflation Risk: The present value of the Defined Benefit Plan liability is calculated with reference to the future salaries of participants under the Plan. Increase in salary might lead to higher liabilities. \\x07 These Plans have a relatively balanced mix of investments in order to manage the above risks. The investment strategy is designed based on the interest rate scenario, liquidity needs of the Plans and pattern of investment as prescribed under various statutes. \\x07 The Trustees regularly monitor the funding and investments of these Plans. Risk mitigation systems are in place to ensure that the health of the portfolio is regularly reviewed and investments do not pose any significant risk of impairment. Periodic audits are conducted to ensure adequacy of internal controls. Pension obligation of the employees is secured by purchasing annuities thereby de-risking the Plans from future payment obligation. 29.\\tAdditional Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Contd.) 302 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 ITC Limited Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 31st March, 2024 (` in Crores) For the year ended 31st March, 2023 (` in Crores) Pension Gratuity Leave Encashment Pension Gratuity Leave Encashment Partially Funded Funded Unfunded Unfunded Partially Funded Funded Unfunded Unfunded I Components of Employer Expense – Recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss 1 Current Service Cost 39.35 42.82 0.54 18.78 43.12 39.58 0.54 18.21 2 Past Service Cost 2.93 – 0.05 0.06 – – 0.17 – 3 Net Interest Cost (3.62) (1.47) 0.49 12.55 (1.32) (1.42) 0.41 10.33 4 Total expense recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss 38.66 41.35 1.08 31.39 41.80 38.16 1.12 28.54 – Remeasurements recognised in Other Comprehensive Income 5 Return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest cost) (23.16) (3.61) – – 14.50 1.22 – – 6 Effect of changes in demographic assumptions 1.65 0.94 0.34 0.49 – – – (0.01) 7 Effect of changes in financial assumptions 25.89 18.64 0.14 6.37 (14.26) (14.79) (0.39) (3.32) 8 Changes in asset ceiling (excluding interest income) – – – – – – – – 9 Effect of experience adjustments (30.13) 22.27 0.09 0.82 (1.24) 32.63 0.22 9.50 10 Total re-measurements included in Other Comprehensive Income (25.75) 38.24 0.57 7.68 (1.00) 19.06 (0.17) 6.17 11 Total defined benefit cost recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss and Other Comprehensive Income (4+10) 12.91 79.59 1.65 39.07 40.80 57.22 0.95 34.71 The current service cost, past service cost and net interest cost for the year, as applicable, pertaining to Pension and Gratuity expenses have been recognised in “Contribution to Provident and other funds” and Leave Encashment in “Salaries and wages” under Note 25.

While each of these sensitivities holds all other assumptions constant, in practice such assumptions rarely change in isolation and the asset value changes may offset the impact to some extent. For presenting the sensitivities, the present value of the Defined Benefit Obligation has been calculated using the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period, which is the same as that applied in calculating the Defined Benefit Obligation presented above.

(ix) \\x07 Under the terms of the Joint Venture Agreement (JVA), Logix Developers Private Limited (LDPL) (CIN: U70101DL2010PTC207640) was to develop a luxury hotel-cum-service apartment complex. However, Logix Estates Private Limited, Noida, the JV partner communicated its intention to explore alternative development plans to which the Company reiterated that it was committed only to the project as envisaged in the JVA. The JV partner refused to progress the project and instead expressed its intent to exit the JV by selling its stake to the Company and subsequently proposed that both parties should find a third party to sell the entire shareholding in LDPL. The resultant deadlock has stalled the project. The Company’s petition that the affairs of the JV are being conducted in a manner that is prejudicial to the interest of the Company and the JV entity, as also a petition for winding up of LDPL filed by Logix Estates, are currently before the Hon’ble National Company Law Tribunal. \\x07 New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (NOIDA), vide letter dated 6th July, 2022, cancelled the sub-lease for the land on which the project was to be constructed on account of non-payment of lease instalments and non-fulfilment of the conditions of the sub-lease, including forfeiture of the amount deposited. Upon cancellation of the sub-lease, LDPL is evaluating all options to pursue its rights. \\x07 The financial statements of LDPL for the year ended 31st March, 2024 are yet to be approved by its Board of Directors. (x) \\x07 During the year, the Group acquired, in the aggregate, 2,443 Equity Shares of ` 10/- each and 9,571 Compulsorily Convertible Preference Shares of ` 10/- each of Sproutlife Foods Private Limited (‘Sproutlife’), for an aggregate consideration of ` 225.00 crores (Refer Note 4), consequent to which the Group’s shareholding in Sproutlife aggregated 44.74% of its share capital on a fully diluted basis as on 31st March, 2024. Sproutlife became an associate of the Group with effect from 4th May, 2023. \\x07 The Group has agreed to acquire 100% of the share capital (on a fully diluted basis) of Sproutlife over a time period of about three to four years from the execution of the transaction documents.

Further, in respect of usage of cloud – based accounting software, where applicable, appropriate contractual restrictions are in place regulating access management at both application and database levels. Consequently, the Group has ensured compliance with aforesaid requirements in respect of audit trails with the exception of the following associates, which are not material to the consolidated financial statements of the Group: \\x07 An associate company of the Group uses a cloud-based Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution for maintenance of its books of account along with an integrated customer invoicing software for which audit trail has been enabled at the application level. Direct access to database is provided only to the authorised personnel from application support team and service provider only for system administration purposes. The service provider is contractually bound not to carry out any direct changes / edits to financial transactions or its underlying database, which if carried out will be considered as a breach of contract. While the audit trail feature is not enabled at database level in the ERP and the invoicing software, any changes made directly in the database are documented through the structured process for system administration activities. \\x07 During the year, another associate company of the Group upgraded its accounting software to comply with the aforesaid requirements in respect of audit trail on 25th May, 2023. While the upgraded software is compliant with the aforesaid requirements, the audit trail feature did not capture details of the user ID for transactions recorded at certain locations accounting for approximately 1% of the total value of transactions for the year of that associate company; the same has since been enabled.

Financial risk management objectives \\x07 Entities comprising the Group have put in place risk management systems as applicable to the respective operations. The following explains the objectives and processes of the Company, being the largest component of the Group: The Company has a system-based approach to risk management, anchored to policies and procedures and internal financial controls aimed at ensuring early identification, evaluation and management of key financial risks (such as market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk) that may arise as a consequence of its business operations as well as its investing and financing activities. Accordingly, the Company’s risk management framework has the objective of ensuring that such risks are managed within acceptable and approved risk parameters in a disciplined and consistent manner and in compliance with applicable regulation. It also seeks to drive accountability in this regard. Liquidity Risk \\x07 The Group’s Current assets aggregate ` 41065.54 Crores (2023 - ` 39670.89 Crores) including Current Investments, Cash and cash equivalents and Other Bank Balances of ` 20162.10 Crores (2023 - ` 22113.05 Crores) against an aggregate Current liabilities of ` 13690.40 Crores (2023 - ` 13739.41 Crores). As part of its surplus liquidity management operations, the Group may sell instruments that are held at amortised cost. Such sales may be infrequent (even if significant in value) or insignificant in value both individually and in aggregate (even if frequent). During the year, the net loss arising on such sale amounted to ` 16.37 Crores (2023 - ` 49.13 Crores) [Refer Note 23]. \\x07 Other Non-current liabilities (other than lease liabilities) due between one year to three years amounted to ` 257.32 Crores (2023 - ` 304.94 Crores) and Other Non-current liabilities due after three years amounted to ` 178.40 Crores (2023 - ` 115.42 Crores) on the reporting date. The maturity analysis of undiscounted lease liabilities are disclosed under Note 29(xi). \\x07 Further, while the Group’s total equity stands at ` 74889.97 Crores (2023 - ` 69538.79 Crores), it has non-current borrowings of ` 1.76 Crores (2023 - ` 3.49 Crores). In such circumstances, liquidity risk or the risk that the Group may not be able to settle or meet its obligations as they become due does not exist. Market Risk 1. Foreign Currency Risk \\x07 The Group undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currency (mainly US Dollar, Pound Sterling, Euro and Japanese Yen) which are subject to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations. Financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency, including the Group’s net investments in foreign operations (with a functional currency other than Indian Rupee), are also subject to reinstatement risks. 324 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 ITC Limited 32.\\tFinancial Instruments and Related Disclosures (Contd.)

The proportion of forecast transactions that are to be hedged is decided based on the size of the forecast transaction and market conditions. As the counterparty for such transactions are primarily highly rated banks or recognised exchange(s), the risk of their non-performance is considered to be insignificant. Where derivatives are not designated under hedge accounting, changes in the fair value of such hedges are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. \\x07 The Company and one of its subsidiaries have designated certain hedge instruments as cash flow hedges to mitigate the risk of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable forecasted cash transactions. The currency, amount and tenure of such hedges are generally matched to the underlying transaction(s). Changes in the fair value of the effective portion of cash flow hedges are recognised as cash flow hedging reserve in Other Comprehensive Income. While the probability of such hedges becoming ineffective is very low, the ineffective portion, if any, is immediately recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The movement in the cash flow hedging reserve in respect of designated cash flow hedges is summarised below: \\x08 (` in Crores) Particulars 2024 2023 At the beginning of the year (1.23) 14.33 Add: Changes in the fair value of effective portion of matured cash flow hedges during the year (6.44) (154.16) Add: Changes in fair value of effective portion of outstanding cash flow hedges (9.02) 12.15 Less: Amounts transferred to the Statement of Profit and Loss on occurrence of forecast hedge transactions during the year (20.53) (82.63) Less: Amounts transferred to the Statement of Profit and Loss due to cash flows no longer expected to occur (1.40) (28.19) Less: Amounts transferred to initial cost of non-financial assets 10.85 (10.40) Less: Net gain / (loss) transferred to the Statement of Profit and Loss on ineffectiveness – – (Less) / Add: Deferred tax 1.11 5.23 At the end of the year (4.50) (1.23) Of the above, balances remaining in cash flow hedge reserve for matured hedging relationships 2.19 (11.20) \\x07 Once the hedged transaction materialises, the amount accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve will be included in the initial cost of the non-financial hedged item on its initial recognition or reclassified to profit or loss, as applicable, in the anticipated timeframes given below: \\x08 (` in Crores) Outstanding balance in Cash Flow Hedge Reserve to be subsequently recycled from OCI As at 31st March, 2024 As at 31st March, 2023 Within one year 0.10 0.98 Between one and three years (2.50) (1.51) Beyond three years (2.10) (0.70) Total (4.50) (1.23) 326 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 ITC Limited 32.\\tFinancial Instruments and Related Disclosures (Contd.) Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Foreign Currency Sensitivity \\x07 For every percentage point increase / decrease in the underlying exchange rate of the outstanding foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, including derivative contracts, holding all other variables constant, the profit before tax for the year ended 31st March, 2024 would decrease / increase by ` 4.30 Crores (2023 - ` 2.72 Crores) and other equity as at 31st March, 2024 would decrease / increase by ` 1.10 Crores (2023 - ` 2.89 Crores) on a pre-tax basis. 2. Interest Rate Risk \\x07 As the Group is virtually debt-free and its deferred payment liabilities do not carry interest, the exposure to interest rate risk from the perspective of financial liabilities is negligible. \\x07 The Group’s investments are predominantly held in bonds / debentures, fixed deposits, certificates of deposit and debt mutual funds. Mark to market movements in respect of the Group’s investments in bonds / debentures that are held at amortised cost are temporary and get recouped through coupon accruals. Other investments in bonds / debentures, certificates of deposit are fair valued through the Statement of Profit and Loss to recognise market volatility, which is not considered to be significant. Fixed deposits are held with highly rated banks and companies and have a short tenure and are not subject to interest rate volatility. \\x07 The Group also invests in debt mutual fund schemes of leading fund houses. Such investments are susceptible to market price risk that arise mainly from changes in interest rate which may impact the return and value of such investments. However, given the relatively short tenure of underlying portfolio of the debt mutual fund schemes in which the Group has invested, such price risk is not significant. 3. Other Price Risk \\x07 The Group is not an active investor in equity markets; it holds certain investments in equity for long term value accretion which are accordingly measured at fair value through Other Comprehensive Income. The value of investments in such equity instruments as at 31st March, 2024 is ` 4676.28 Crores (2023 - ` 1723.70 Crores). Accordingly, fair value fluctuations arising from market volatility is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income. \\x07 For select agricultural commodities primarily held for trading, futures contracts are used to hedge price risks till positions in the physical market are matched. The carrying value of inventories is adjusted to the extent of fair value movement of the risk being hedged. Such hedges are generally for short time horizons and recognised in profit or loss within the crop cycle and are managed by the business within the approved policy framework. Accordingly, the Group’s net exposure to commodity price risk is considered to be insignificant. Credit Risk \\x07 Each entity comprising the Group manages its own credit risk. The following explains the processes followed by the Company, being the largest component of the Group, to manage its credit risk: Company’s deployment in debt instruments are primarily in Government securities, fixed deposits with highly rated banks and companies, bonds issued by government institutions, public sector undertakings, mutual fund schemes of leading fund houses and certificates of deposit issued by highly rated banks and financial institutions. As these counter parties are Central / State Government, Government institutions / public sector undertakings with investment grade / sovereign credit ratings and taking into account the experience of the Company over time, the counter party risk attached to such assets is considered to be insignificant. \\x07 The Group’s investments that are held at amortised cost stood at ` 14447.05 Crores (2023 - ` 16422.36 Crores). \\x07 The Company’s customer base is large and diverse limiting the risk arising out of credit concentration. Company’s payment terms generally ranges from advance (generally settled within the operating cycle) to a credit period of up to 180 days, depending upon specific circumstances and industry practices. Credit is extended in business interest in accordance with guidelines issued centrally and business-specific credit policies that are consistent with such guidelines. Exceptions are managed and approved by appropriate authorities, after due consideration of the counterparty’s credentials and financial capacity, trade practices and prevailing business and economic conditions. There is no significant financing component and / or remaining performance obligation in respect of its transaction with the customers for sale of goods and services. \\x07 The Company’s historical experience of collecting receivables and the level of default indicate that credit risk is low and generally uniform across markets; consequently, trade receivables are considered to be a single class of financial assets. All overdue customer balances are evaluated taking into account the age of the dues, specific credit circumstances, the track record of the counterparty etc. Loss allowances and impairment is recognised, where considered appropriate by responsible management.\\nREPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 327 ITC Limited 32.\\tFinancial Instruments and Related Disclosures (Contd.)

If significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2.\\nREPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 329 ITC Limited \\x07 Derivatives are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs such as foreign exchange spot rates and forward rates at the end of the reporting period, yield curves, risk free rate of returns, volatility etc., as applicable. The fair value of investment in Bonds / Debentures, Certificates of Deposit, Venture Capital funds etc. and financial liabilities, where applicable, is determined using market observable inputs such as quotes from market participants, value published by the issuer etc. Level 3: Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). \\x07 If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the fair value is determined using generally accepted methodologies such as discounted cash flow analysis, with the most significant inputs being the discount rate that reflects the credit risk of counterparty. \\x07 The fair value of trade receivables, trade payables and other current financial assets and liabilities is considered to be equal to the carrying amounts of these items due to their short – term nature. Where such items are non-current in nature, the same has been classified as Level 3 and fair value determined using discounted cash flow basis. Similarly, unquoted equity instruments where most recent information to measure fair value is insufficient, or if there is a wide range of possible fair value measurements, cost has been considered as best estimate of fair value. \\x07 There has been no change in the valuation methodology for Level 3 inputs during the year. The Group has not classified any material financial instruments under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The sensitivity of change in the unobservable inputs used in fair valuation of Level 3 financial assets and liabilities does not have a significant impact on their value. There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 during the year.\\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 32.\\tFinancial Instruments and Related Disclosures (Contd.)

At March 31, 2024, the carrying value of Capital Work in Progress (‘CWIP’) and inventories (excluding leasehold land value of ` 227.63 crores) is ` 1,710.78 crores and ` 1,003.22 crores respectively. The management of WLPL has performed impairment assessment for its capital work in progress of the Hotel (PPE) and net realisable value assessment for the inventory of the residential apartments considering slowdown in the Sri Lankan economy in past few years which is gradually stabilizing. The processes and methodologies for assessing and determining the recoverable value of the project are based on assumptions, that by their nature imply the use of the management’s judgement, in particular with reference to forecast of future cash flows, selling price, balance cost to complete the project, selling costs, terminal value, long-term growth rates and discount rates applied to such forecasted cash flows. Considering the judgement required for estimating the cash flows and the assumptions used, this is considered as a key audit matter.\\nRefer Note 1 – Material Accounting Policies and Note 2 – Use of estimates and judgements to the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements.\\nOur audit procedures included the following: \\x07 Obtained understanding of the Company’s policy on assessment of impairment of PPE and determination of net realisable value for inventory and assumptions used by the management including design and implementation of controls. \\x07 Obtained and read the projections / estimated selling price / future cashflows along with sensitivity analysis thereof. \\x07 Discussed and obtained from component auditor of WLPL their assessment of potential indicators of impairment of PPE and recoverable value of inventory. \\x07 Evaluated management’s methodology, assumptions and estimates used in the calculations. \\x07 Compared projections shared by the management in previous year with the actuals for the year ended March 31, 2024. \\x07 Performed sensitivity analysis around impact on future cash flows due to changes in key assumptions considered by management. \\x07 Verified the arithmetical accuracy of the future cash flow model including comparison with approved budgets. \\x07 Assessed the recoverability of PPE with regard to the value in use and net realisable value of inventory.\\nIndependent Auditor’s Report 332 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 ITC Limited Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the consolidated Ind AS financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the consolidated Ind AS financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether such other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated Ind AS financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\\nResponsibilities of Management for the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements The Holding Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these consolidated Ind AS financial statements in terms of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial performance including other comprehensive income, consolidated cash flows and consolidated statement of changes in equity of the Group including its associates and joint ventures in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates and joint ventures are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of their respective companies and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.\\nIn preparing the consolidated Ind AS financial statements, the respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates and joint ventures are responsible for assessing the ability of their respective companies to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\\nThose respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates and joint ventures are also responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of their respective companies.\\nAuditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated Ind AS financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated Ind AS financial statements.\\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \\x07 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit Independent Auditor’s Report REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 333 ITC Limited procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. \\x07 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. \\x07 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management. \\x07 Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group and its associates and joint ventures to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated Ind AS financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and its associates and joint ventures to cease to continue as a going concern. \\x07 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated Ind AS financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. \\x07 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group and its associates and joint ventures of which we are the independent auditors and whose financial information we have audited, to express an opinion on the consolidated Ind AS financial statements.

We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\\nOther Matter (a) \\x07 We did not audit the financial statements and other financial information, in respect of twenty-four subsidiaries, whose financial statements include total assets of ` 8,009.91 crores as at March 31, 2024, and total revenues of ` 3,666.49 crores and net cash inflows of ` 43.60 crores for the year ended on that Independent Auditor’s Report 334 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 ITC Limited date.

Risk Mitigation Strategy Physical Risk Management: • Usage of contemporary climate risk modelling tools for identifying high-risk/vulnerable sites and agri value chains, and undertaking detailed assessments for developing locally contextual adaptation plans, risk mitigation strategies and undertaking measures for improving climate resilience; • Promotion of climate smart agriculture, and development of heat/ drought tolerant and high yielding varieties to improve productivity by adopting micro region-specific agronomic practices: -\\tDeveloping region-specific package of practices and promoting climate smart farming techniques to mitigate impact of weather; -\\tEnhancing climate resilience of farmers through capacity building programmes by leveraging ITCMAARS and the Farmers’ Producer Organisation (FPO) ecosystem, supported by field demonstrations under Choupal Pradarshan Khets; -\\tComprehensive programmes on social forestry, soil and moisture conservation and biodiversity conservation; Potential impact • As average temperatures rise, extreme weather events are expected to grow in terms of severity and frequency which could have significant impact on the Company’s operations, its physical assets and agri value chains. These may lead to complete or partial outage of operations. Further, these events may also adversely impact the availability and quality of agri raw materials and consequently, the production and sales of the Company’s products; • Vagaries of weather caused by climate change may impact crop cycles, output and productivity resulting in disruption of operations/ supply chain; • Availability of water for own operations as well as agri value chains may be adversely impacted by erratic precipitation patterns; • Besides physical risks, transition risks associated with climate change, may impact the Company’s operations: -\\tAdditional levies may be imposed by regulatory authorities for emission/ water intensive industries to address climate change, resulting in higher cost of compliance, and potential regulatory penalties and reputational risk in case of non-compliance.

Additionally undertaking third party assurance of underlying data related to plastic waste generation and collection; -\\tEnsuring a robust compliance management system supported by internal and external process review; • Partnering with upstream players and suppliers for ensuring supply of recycled plastic for meeting regulatory/ market demand for increasing recycled content in plastic packaging; • Harnessing the enterprise strengths of ITC (Life Sciences and Technology Centre, Paperboards & Specialty Paper Division and Packaging and Printing Division) in driving cutting-edge innovation to offer sustainable alternatives to single use plastics. Pursue sustainable packaging initiatives like reduction in plastic packaging intensity and improving recyclability of plastic packaging.\\nPotential impact •Non-compliance with plastic waste management regulations could lead to imposition of environmental compensation, that may negatively impact Company’s reputation. Additionally, stricter government laws around usage of plastics including bans may give rise to multiple challenges such as redesign of product packaging, shelf life- and product distribution related issues; •Disruptions in the supply chain for recycled plastic or plastic packaging substitutes as required by law, could impact the Company’s ability to comply, produce and distribute products; •Inability to provide sustainable alternatives could have a negative impact on consumer sentiment.\\nREPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report XII S.

Accordingly, focus of ITC’s interventions in agri value chains has been largely around improving farmer livelihoods, increasing agricultural productivity, strengthening regional water security, and addressing the challenge of climate change and enhancing resilience. ITC’s key agri value chains are also certified as per global standards like Rainforest Alliance (RFA), Forest Stewardship Council®, Fairtrade, India Organic, USDA Organic and Bio-Suisse.

In this context, the Company has laid down a four layered mechanism to deal with the aspect of stakeholder engagement. The Board, through the CSR and Sustainability Committee, inter alia, reviews, monitors and provides strategic direction to the Company’s CSR and sustainability practices towards fulfilling its Triple Bottom Line objectives. Half-yearly reports on the progress made by the Company in this regard are placed by the CMC before the CSR and Sustainability Committee. The CMC in turn has constituted the Sustainability Compliance Review Committee (SCRC), comprising senior members of management, which evaluates and monitors compliance with the Policy formulated in this connection. The SCRC places a quarterly report on the subject before the CMC.\\nThe Company has a practice of periodically assessing employee engagement through a Company-wide survey. Since 2016, the Company has made a concerted effort to assess and improve engagement. The impact is visible in the consistent improvement of engagement over the years.\\n2.\\tWhether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identification and management of environmental, and social topics (Yes/No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.\\nYes, the Company believes that an effective stakeholder engagement process is necessary for achieving its sustainability goal of inclusive growth. Accordingly, the Company anchors stakeholder engagement on the following principles: a) Materiality – Prioritised consideration of the economic, environmental and social impacts identified to be important to the stakeholders as well as the organisation.\\nb) Completeness – Understanding key concerns of stakeholders and their expectations.\\nREPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report XXXI c) Responsiveness – Responding coherently and transparently to such issues and concerns. The Company has put in place systems and procedures to identify, prioritise and address the needs and concerns of its stakeholders across Businesses and Units in a continuous, consistent and systematic manner. It has implemented mechanisms to facilitate effective dialogues with all stakeholders across Businesses, identify material concerns and their resolution in an equitable and transparent manner. These measures have helped the Company develop strong relationships, which have stood the test of time. Select examples of how stakeholder inputs have been incorporated into ITC’s policies and activities are presented below: 1.\\tInvestors: The Company engages extensively with the investor ecosystem i.e., analysts representing institutional equity investors, fund/portfolio managers in top FIIs, Domestic Mutual Funds, FPIs, Private Insurance Companies etc. The Company hosted its second ‘Investor Day’ event for the investor community to provide deeper insights into ITC’s Corporate Strategy and operating segments including inter alia, the ‘ITC Next Strategy’ which incorporates Sustainability 2.0 as a significant strategic pillar of the organisation. The event was hosted in hybrid mode with over 100 physical attendees and 400+ overall attendees. The Company continues to communicate quarterly performance takeaways through press releases and detailed Investor presentations along with post-result calls with analysts. Key highlights of the performance are also being shared with the shareholders by e-mail. The Investors section of the Company’s website is also being updated on an ongoing basis. The Company is well-recognised for its ESG credentials, and is acknowledged as one of the pioneers of adopting the Triple Bottom Line philosophy in India. 2.\\tCustomers & Value Chain Partners: Customers, Consumers and Value Chain Partners are some of ITC’s core stakeholders. Various tech-enabled avenues have been deployed to constantly receive feedback and ideas from these stakeholders.\\nA specialised team, ‘Team Synthesis’, has progressively evolved from being a ‘Customer Interactions’ team to a ‘Customer Experience’ team to ‘Stakeholder Experience Team’, and now into a ‘Stakeholder Experience Management Team’. In its current avatar, in addition to keeping customer centricity as the base, SOPs and policies are designed and implemented in such a manner that the experience of all stakeholders is taken into equitable consideration. This has not just helped in achieving better experience for customers as well as the employees, but has also made every stakeholder accountable for the team’s and the organisation’s growth. Rapidly evolving consumer needs are constantly being monitored through social listening, in-depth immersions and are being carefully synthesised to transform into relevant solutions. A few key initiatives that demonstrate the above are: • The entire customer experience process has been incentivised for the associates, team leaders as well as for the Quality Analysts (QAs) in such a manner that each month they accumulate certain points for their monthly performance based on objective and quantitative parameters. This has given the primary stakeholders (the associates) an opportunity to perform better. The parameters include factors like ideation (KAIZEN) and initiatives taken beyond tasks to improve the process continuously.\\n• The scenarios related to matters like environment, product, packaging, ergonomics, quality engineering, etc. highlighted by the customers are answered as per the respective brand teams, and any new or unique scenario highlighted by the customers is shared with the respective stakeholders as a VOC (Voice of Customer).\\n3. Community: Presented ahead are some of the instances where inputs received from stakeholders were incorporated into interventions. Core Area Perspective Plan (CAPP) is done in ITC’s catchments to understand the need of the communities and design the interventions basis that. A comprehensive community needs assessment was earlier undertaken in 2015-16 in ITC’s core areas, that is, factory and agri-catchments. Basis this the CAPP 1.0 was developed. Whilst we keep revisiting the needs, basis regular stakeholder engagements, CAPP 2.0 was taken up in FY 2021-22 which also focussed on ITC’s core catchments across 21 factories and 7 agri locations. The objectives of CAPP 2.0 were to: • Revisit coverage and community needs in the changed external context; • Assess reasons for not achieving the earlier planned outcomes (if any); and • Re-strategise MSK themes and approach based on the findings As a follow up to the second CAPP 2.0 done in FY 2021-22, household surveys are conducted every year on a lower sample to re-assess and reaffirm the continued relevance of the needs identified and accordingly cognise for the same in the future plans. In FY 2023-24, over 6,000 households across 4 states were covered.\\nForming large-scale long-term partnerships with Government to amplify reach & scale is one of the core tenets of SIP’s implementation approach. In this case, stakeholder feedback was received REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report XXXII through consultations and interactions and they were duly incorporated during renewal/extension of the partnership. During the year, some PPPs with government ended and discussions were initiated on what changes and additions need to be considered in the next phase of partnership. Two such examples are shared below: • In Madhya Pradesh, Climate Smart Village (CSV) programme is being implemented in 1,500 villages by ITC directly. Considering the need for replicating CSVs across the state, ITC organised field visits for the State Agricultural Department. Post visits, discussions were taken up on how can CSV model be replicated by the Government. ITC presented its CSV approach to Department’s state and district level officials. Post the meetings, an MoU was signed to replicate ITC’s CSV model in the entire state starting with six districts in Phase-1. The CSV approach will be replicated by the Government staff with ITC’s support for capability building. On-ground delivery of the programme has since been initiated.\\n• In Andhra Pradesh, ITC was working with Women Development and Child Welfare in the area of Early Childhood Education and Care (ECCE) in 13 districts. ITC trained Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) Supervisors who in turn cascaded the training to Anganwadi Sevikas. After successfully implementing the programme in 13 districts, it was decided that there is a need to replicate the approach to entire state. Accordingly, a MoU was signed with the Department during FY 2023-24 to expand the partnership to the entire state.\\n3.\\tProvide details of instances of engagement with, and actions taken to, address the concerns of vulnerable/marginalized stakeholder groups.\\nITC’s SIP adopts a bottoms-up approach to identify and address the emerging needs of the community. Presented hereunder are a few instances wherein changing community needs were addressed either through modifications in ongoing programme components or by introducing entirely new interventions.\\n• ITC through the skill training centres provides vocational training to unemployed youth from marginalised sections to help them get livelihood opportunities. In Pune, unemployed women from two villages were not able to travel to the skill centre as traveling cost was high, which they were not able to bear. During mobilisation meetings, the community requested if training can be provided in a nearby place. To overcome the challenge, ITC started a temporary community level vocational skilling centre in their villages itself. 27 youth from these villages including 20 women were trained in electrical trade with all required equipment and standards.\\n• In ITC catchments, toilets have been constructed and catchments were declared Open Defecation Free (ODF) by the Government, but many of the earlier constructed toilets are single pit. During meetings, the community expressed requirement of double pit toilets as their single pit toilet may get filled up in the coming year and thus toilet will become non-usable. In a twin pit toilet, once one pit is filled up, second pit is used and desludging is done for faecal sludge management in first pit. To address this, ITC worked with the local Swachh Bharat Mission team and helped needy households to retrofit another pit to their existing toilet. This intervention would thus help in sustaining the ODF status of the area.\\n• ITC has been working with Watershed Development Department of Karnataka as part of its partnership for drought proofing programme for last three years. In the current year, there was severe drought in North Karnataka districts which required additional support. ITC immediately geared up to respond to the issue by designing and implementing drought support interventions in three North Karnataka districts – Balagavi, Kalaburagi and Yadgir. ITC provided critical irrigation support using rain guns, liquid fertiliser application through drones, renovation of open wells and water bodies, and fodder support to feed the animals. Approximately 2,200 poor households were benefited covering 3,000 acres, who could save their rabi crop, ensure survival of their animals and also had income generation opportunities in the village itself.\\n• In Kapurthala district of Punjab, ITC has been implementing Crop Residue Management programme since 2018, to help farmers not to burn paddy crop residue and to incorporate stubble into soil in order to improve soil health. However, over a period of time, farmers realised that in addition to adding stubble into soil, there is also a need for options to sell stubble (ex-situ solutions) and generate income. Considering this need, a small pilot was taken up in 2022-23 with 10 rural entrepreneurs which was extended to 73 entrepreneurs in 2023-24. These entrepreneurs handled 1,900 tons of residue which was sold for fodder and ethanol purposes. A workshop was also organised in December 2023, to make the farmers aware of various ex-situ marketing solutions available. Solutions discussed included Biofuel, Bio-ethanol, Building material, Biogass, Biochar, Pellets, Kitchen and tableware. The solutions which were of interest to farmers were listed out and are being pursued in the field by connecting farmers and rural entrepreneurs with the specific buyers/end-users.\\nREPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report XXXIII Businesses should respect and promote human rights Essential Indicators 1.\\tEmployees and workers who have been provided training on human rights issues and policy(ies) of the entity, in the following format: Category 2023-24 2022-23 Total (A) No. of Employees/ Workers Covered (B) % (B/A) Total (C) No. of Employees/ Workers Covered (D) % (D/C) Employees Permanent 24,567 24,567 100% 23,725 23,725 100% Other than Permanent 30,679 30,679 100% 26,099 26,099 100% Total Employees 55,246 55,246 100% 49,824 49,824 100% Workers Permanent 12,745 12,745 100% 12,602 12,602 100% Other than Permanent 30,386 30,386 100% 25,987 25,987 100% Total Workers 43,131 43,131 100% 38,589 38,589 100% 2.\\tDetails of minimum wages paid to employees and workers, in the following format: Category 2023-24 2022-23 Total (A) Equal to Minimum Wage (B) % (B/A) More than Minimum Wage (C) % (C/A) Total (D) Equal to Minimum Wage (E) % (E/D) More than Minimum Wage (F) % (F/D) Employees Permanent 24,567 310 1% 24,257 99% 23,725 41 0.2% 23,684 99.83% Male 21,804 278 1% 21,526 99% 21,337 40 0.2% 21,297 99.8% Female 2,763 32 1% 2,731 99% 2,388 1 0% 2,387 100% Other than Permanent 30,679 10,963 36% 19,716 64% 26,099 8,819 34% 17,280 66% Male 25,729 8,274 32% 17,455 68% 22,157 6,571 30% 15,586 70% Female 4,950 2,689 54% 2,261 46% 3,942 2,248 57% 1,694 43% Workers Permanent 12,745 310 2% 12,435 98% 12,602 41 0.3% 12,561 99.7% Male 11,966 278 2% 11,688 98% 11,948 40 0.3% 11,908 99.7% Female 779 32 4% 747 96% 654 1 0.2% 653 99.8% Other than Permanent 30,386 10,870 36% 19,516 64% 25,987 8,819 34% 17,168 66% Male 25,518 8,217 32% 17,301 68% 22,061 6,571 30% 15,490 70% Female 4,868 2,653 54% 2,215 46% 3,926 2,248 57% 1,678 43% Principle 5 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report XXXIV 3. a.

Basis for opinion We conducted our engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 (Revised), Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the “Our responsibilities” section of our report. 1 Notified by SEBI vide circular number SEBI/HO/CFD/CFD-SEC-2/P/CIR/2023/122 dated 12 July 2023 REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2024 Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report LIII 2 | P a g e We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA). Our firm applies International Standard on Quality Management (ISQM) 1, Quality Management for Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Statements, or Other Assurance or Related Services Engagements, issued by the IAASB. This standard requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management, including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Other information Management and the Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Company’s Annual Report (but does not include the Identified Sustainability Information and assurance report thereon). The Company’s Annual Report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this assurance report. Our reasonable assurance opinion on the Identified Sustainability Information does not cover the other information and we will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our assurance on the Identified Sustainability Information, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above when it becomes available, and in doing so, consider whether other information is materially inconsistent with the Identified Sustainability Information or our knowledge obtained in the assurance, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. Other matter The BRSR for the period from 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 was not subject to limited/reasonable assurance engagement and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion/conclusion, or provide any assurance on such information.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the reporting process for the Company’s ISI. Inherent limitations in preparing the ISI The preparation of the Company’s BRSR information requires the management to establish or interpret the criteria, make determinations about the relevancy of information to be included, and make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported information. Measurement of certain amounts and BRSR Core metrics, some of which are estimates, is subject to substantial inherent measurement uncertainty, for example, GHG emissions, water footprint, energy footprint. Obtaining sufficient appropriate evidence to support our opinion/conclusion does not reduce the uncertainty in the amounts and metrics. Our responsibilities We are responsible for: • Planning and performing the engagement to obtain reasonable assurance on the sustainability disclosures in the BRSR Core are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria in line with the section above. • Forming an independent opinion, based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, and • Reporting our reasonable assurance opinion to the Directors of ITC Limited.
